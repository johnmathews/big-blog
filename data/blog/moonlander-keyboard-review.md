# What

In April 2022 I bought the ZSA [Moonlander Mark 1](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) keyboard. It's a
split mechanical keyboard and each half can be tilted.

8 months later I bought the "Platform" accessory - a stand that allows each half to be tilted up to
45 degrees, and that adds a lot of extra weight to the keyboard which prevents it moving as easily.

I bought it partly as an experiment and partly as a toy. The review articles were glowing, and I
figured that I spend so much time with a keyboard that even a small improvement would create a big
benefit over time.

The Moonlander is very customizable - the hardware can be customised by changing the tilt of the
keys, and you can position each half to be whatever distance and rotation you find comfortable. The
keyboard caps are a standard size so you can replace them if you want to, though I haven't done
this. I have replaced the key switches though - they're "hot swappable", which means you can simply
pull them out of the keyboards circuit board - no need for solder. This is a big advantage because
the switches are the main source of noise and tactile feedback, and being able to choose your own
switches will make the keyboard fit in with your preferences more than almost any other feature.

The software to program what each key does is also very customizable, and there are a lot of tools
to help you practice too. The keyboard supports multiple layers of keys, as well as macros,
modifiers and combinations.

The Moonlander has all the RGB light options you can imagine, and I use none of them. It also has a
mostly undocumented musical keyboard setting. You could play happy birthday to your colleagues if
you wanted.

I modified the keyboard by adding some foam packaging into the housing so that the sound is duller
and softer when typing. I also replaced the switches with ALIAZ
[Silent Tactile Switches](https://kbdfans.com/products/pre-orderaliaz-silent-switch-tactile) - these
were the only silent _and_ tactile switches I could find, and I realised after some experimentation
that I really wanted to be able to type quietly.

# The learning curve

Getting used to a split keyboard is not easy or fast. The first few weeks are really tricky because
it feels so unusual to have your hands far apart, and muscle-memory tends to work against you.

I also found the number of options and opportunities to customise to be almost overwhelming - you
can design your layout almost anyway you want, I'd never used thumb clusters before and found it
easiest to avoid all but the two nearest thumb-cluster keys until I was more comfortable with
everything else.

I also realised that I prefer to have each hand oriented towards the left side of each half, and
that I want to keep my fingers close the home-row as much as possible.

You can see my [layout history here](https://configure.zsa.io/my_layout/view/Dnj6q).

## Summary

- Change by degree - you can't go from using a laptop keyboard to the optimal split keyboard layout,
  you will have to have intermediate layouts that you tweak as you get used to things. Because:

  - The learning curve is too steep otherwise
  - You don't know what the optimal layout is
  - Optimal depends on what keys you can comfortably hit, and that will change as your hands become
    more used to various movements that are unique to split keyboards with thumb clusters.

- I quickly became comfortable with the tilting.
- The split took a little longer to get used to, I was used to pressing `y` and `n` with my left
  hand.

# The Platform

"The Platform" is an accessory that lets you tilt (or tent) the Moonlander even further. It also
makes each half a lot heavier and grips the desk far better. I think its still in beta - ZSA seem to
be doing limited runs. Initially I dismissed it as expensive and unnecessary, but came to regret
this and bought one from the second product run.

It adds a lot of weight and rigidity to the Moonlander and really changes how the product feels. It
raises the keyboard up about 10mm or so, increases the tilt of each half, and in my opinion makes
the keyboard feel a lot more luxurious and more visually striking. Most importantly, the extra tilt
is more comfortable and it's easier to type quickly and accurately.

# Conclusions

- I've learnt a lot more about keyboard ergonomics than I bargained for.
- I know that being able to type silently is more important than any other switch characteristic.
- When choosing which to keys to program to do a particular thing, some actions benefit from a big
  unusual movement (like switching application by reaching for a thumb cluster), whilst some actions
  feel best when making a small fast movement (like typing punctuation)
- Having bought new switches, and the Platform accessory, this has become a really expensive
  keyboard. If I use it continually for many years then I think its a fine investment - I'll rack up
  thousands of hours with it.
- Its taken about 8 months to start feeling like I'm more productive, faster, and more accurate than
  with a normal keyboard. It was usable after a couple of months, but only now does it feel
  significantly more accurate, and therefore faster.
- Your time investment will likely be different based on how rapidly you iterate to your ideal
  layout
