Design patterns are generalized abstractions that solve common problems and help
engineers create complex code reliably and quickly. I first heard about design
patterns from Aaron Maxwell in his [Powerful
Python](https://powerfulpython.com/) newsletter, and made some
[notes](python-notes) in an earlier article.

Then the YouTube algorithm put the following video on my front page, and down
the rabbit hole I went.

Take a look at the Borg design pattern.
