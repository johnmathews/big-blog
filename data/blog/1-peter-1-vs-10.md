<mark>Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace
that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully, inquiring what person or
time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the
sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. It was revealed to them that
they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been
announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy
Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.</mark>

The salvation that Peter is referring to is described
[previously](1-peter-1-vs-3). He was encouraging us that
even though our salvation is mysterious it is very valuable, and that the
inexpressible joy that we feel is not unusual or a cause for concern. Don't be
uncomfortable. Grace and peace.

To encourage us even more, Peter tells us that even the prophets (he implicitly
assumes his readers are familiar with the prophets, so I guess they're
definitely Jewish, as guessed in the first post in this series) searched
for understanding about our salvation.

They wanted to know who the Christ would be and when he would arrive. I guess
they initially thought they were doing this to satisfy their own curiosity
because it had to be revealed to them that this was in fact a service to the
saints that would come after them.

Interestingly, it says that it was the Spirit who predicted Christ's sufferings
and the following glories. I would not have expected that the Spirit of God
needed to do any predicting about Christ's sufferings or glories. Are you even
able to predict something if you're omnipotent?

Back to the text, Peters says that things have been announced to us via those
who preached the good news to us by the Hold Spirit, who was sent from heaven.

Preaching by the power or enabling of the Holy Spirit has revealed things to us
that angels long[ref]Long, or longed? I would have expected it to be "longed to
know", but its not. Does chronology get messed up from our perspective if the
other party is outside of time?[/ref] to know. We don't know everything, and we
still have questions, but some of our questions are answered, some of them
inexpressibly, and some of the things we find mysterious or uncomfortable are
supposed to be so until our salvation is complete. Grace and peace. Hang in
there, you're doing ok.
