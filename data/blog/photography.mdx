- Photography is visual communication, which is some kinds of universal language.

  - even if you yourself are the intended viewer and its whimsical or playful, there is still
    _something_ that you are trying to convey.

- There must be a subject, a very obvious "thing" that the photo is about. Have respect for the
  subject - isolate it, and arrange the other elements depending on their relationship to the
  subject. Leaving as much other stuff out of the frame will increase subject isolation and convey
  intentionality.

- Can you see what the photographer was trying to say?
