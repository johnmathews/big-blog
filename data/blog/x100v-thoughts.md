## Background

At different times, I've often found photography mesmerizing and frustrating. Memories fade and our
thoughts and feelings about past events are very much dependent on other seemingly independent
events. Photography offers an opportunity to deliberately craft our relationships with our past.
Choose what you want to remember, say it visually, and cast it into something that cannot be
changed.

I bought my first camera because I was frustrated with my inability to paint. It was an HP850 I
bought sometime around 2002, and it was probably awful. But I poured so much attention and ambition
into it that seeing it just now when I googled it after ~20 years brought back a wave of feelings. I
remember it feeling advanced and powerful, and I also remember it being useful in low light
situations. Absolutely useless.

The next camera I bought, probably around 2005 was a Ricoh. It was also a small fixed lens camera,
but it was sold to me with promises of much improved low light capabilities, and competent
autofocus. It was still useless in the evenings and at social events. Cameras with interchangeable
lenses were too expensive, but were becoming cheaper and I concluded that if I really wanted to do
photography then I would need to a DSLR.

I bought a Nikon D80 with a kit lens, and eventually a 50mm prime. I treasured it, knew its menus
backwards, and began to learn about photography. I was asked to photograph someones wedding, and
shortly after decided to commit and buy a body will a full-frame sensor and some better lenses.
Financially this was a mistake, but I have a hunch that the experience benefited me indirectly and
led to other good things. Nonetheless, that money could have been used differently to gain other
experiences that would probably have been more beneficial.

This was around 2010, and my way of learning photography was the occasional book from Amazon and
following about ~100 photography blogs. Most of these blogs were pure marketing, and I didn't
realise this until much later. I don't recall knowing any other photographers, and after a few years
I was becoming increasingly frustrated with my photography skills. I disliked how the act of
photography made me an observer and took me out of the moment. Camera phones were becoming useful
and I enjoyed using my iPhone far more than my cumbersome Nikon. I decided to let photography slide
and make photographs only when I felt like it. No pressure.

12 years later, in 2022, I was watching YouTube and following a German couple bikepack across
Europe. They were producing incredible videos and photographs and I wondered how they were doing it
whilst carrying everything on their bike. It was all created using a Fujifilm X-T4, and a
smartphone. I wondered how much photography had changed in the last decade, and I was amazed how
much I could learn from other photographer's YouTube channels. It was _very_ different to the
internet of 2008 - 2010.

This brings us to now.

Obsessing over gear is easy and damaging, for me. In the past I've become so aware of technical
limitations that I've forgotten the emotional motivation of photography. I wanted to avoid that this
time, and figured I would keep things simple and accept the risk of being suboptimal. Henry Merk was
producing work that I found inspiring, so I copied his equipment choices. Simple.

And I guess it worked - I bought an X-T5 and some primes, and got to work. I made progress, became
comfortable with the camera and had fun making some photographs. I was progressing.

A good photograph often looks so simple. Beauty often hides complexity. Unfortunately the act of
photography, which includes editing, is not simple at all. You need stuff, you need time, you need
opportunity and you need to try hard. I now have a new laptop, which I would have needed to buy
eventually, anyway. But its frustrating how complex the feedback loop is - make some photos, Cull
and edit them, reflect, repeat. A laptop that takes several seconds to process edits or to show
another photo does not encourage nascent creative flow.

I'm not sure when I first heard about the X100V, but I certainly tried to ignore it. I hate that I
find gear reviews interesting. It's so much easier to consume content than to produce something. The
comparisons to Leica certainly caught my attention though. And the hype seemed extraordinary. It's 3
years old, second hand models are selling for more than they initially cost, and Fuji have stopped
taking new orders because they cant produce enough cameras to fill existing orders...

I visited family in London recently and despite knowing that many moments would make a nice
photograph, my XT-5 stayed in its bag because I didn't want to impact the moment by putting a large
(maybe medium) lump of metal and glass on the table, or point it at someone and interrupt them.
Photography is an art and full of intangible reactions. Qualitative considerations have consequences
and a small playful camera like the X100V leads to different photographs that something larger like
that XT-5.

I run a lot - slow and far - and I often see things I'd like to photograph. I tried putting the XT-5
in my pack whilst running, but this requires stopping, taking the pack off, unzipping it and then
beginning to photograph. Its arduous, slow, laborious. And then you have to do it all in reverse
when you're ready to move on. Hopefully you haven't cooled down too much, and hopefully its easy to
get back into the flow of running whilst hungry and tired. Finding that steady contentment during
perpetual movement and forward progress through changing landscapes, whilst relying on tired legs
and limited calories. I wish I could have carried my XT-5 whilst keeping it accessible.

I've sold the XT-5, and the three prime lenses. I bought a second hand X100V from a business in
Seoul. I thought I was getting a deal but that was before the import tax. My bad. The net cost is
almost zero.

I am surprised that a 3 year old, fixed lens camera, with half hearted video capabilities, no IBIS,
and a mere 24 megapixel sensor, could be better (in almost every meaningful sense, to me) than the
latest flagship camera body and some incredible lenses. But I think this shows me how much I still
have to learn about photography, and how deeply I've been duped by years of marketing. Photography
is an art - all those outstanding and incredibly photographs I find inspiring were made using
equipment far, far worse than a camera phone, right? (Actually, I disagree with that - it is the
wrong way to think about the topic.) Some technical specifications matter more than others, and for
me, size is almost at the top. If it can't fit in my pocket then it probably wont be in my hand.

So after 1 week of fun and frequent photography of the streets, my village, my kids, my house...
here are some thoughts.

## Thoughts after 1 week

1. It’s **fun**. This is not a trivial quality for a complicated tool to possess.
2. It’s small(er) and that’s a really big deal, more than I expected.
3. It’s very right-handed. Probably the most right-handed object I own. I am left handed.
4. You can use it with one hand, this is also a really big deal.
5. Having any camera in your hand, or pocket, is totally different and preferably to having a better camera in your
   bag.
6. Having a built in flash is super fun and engaging. It’s a fun “look”, and it changes the
   experience of being photographed for the better. The subject knows when the photo has been taken,
   it’s more of an “event”, more different, and therefore more special. It “feels” like they've had
   their photo taken in a more tangible way than without a flash.
7. It looks inviting and interesting to the people who will be in your photographs.
8. The lens is wonderful. It makes beautiful photos.
9. The controls are great - the aperture ring, shutter speed dial and exposure compensation dials in
   particular feel sturdy and well made. It feels good to hold and operate.
10. The dials are strong, firm, and clicky. They feel premium.
11. The camera feels like it’ll last a long time.
12. The view finder is fun.
13. The flip screen is great for waste height shots

## Improvements

If and when a successor arrives..

1. Bigger battery - you want to start the day with a full battery for sure
2. Quieter lens
3. Better autofocus
4. Fuji UI isn't intuitive. You have to google stuff to figure out how to use it
5. Better video - 4k 60, 6k 30 would be nice
6. IBIS. But not at the expense of size.
7. Screen that tilts horizontally as well as vertically
8. A dedicated switch or button to go into video mode - I really want to use this camera for video too! Don't bury the switch in a menu.
9. Different sets of custom modes for video and stills - like on the XT-5.
10. A screen that can "vertically" as well as horizontally. Also, whilst we're here, I'd like it to
    flip all the way around - through 180 degrees - so that I can see the screen whilst standing in
    front of the camera.

That's all.
