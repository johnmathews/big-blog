# Selling Checklist

1. Top Cap &thickapprox; Market Cap [chart](https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-valuations/)
2. MVRV > 4 [chart](http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-price-models/)
3. S2F deflection > 3, but noisy [chart](https://twitter.com/s2fmultiple/status/1387991423400689664/photo/3)
4. 0.875 &times; Delta Cap &thickapprox; Realised Cap [chart](http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-price-models/).
5. HODL waves - 45% moved in the last 6 months [chart](https://unchained-capital.com/hodlwaves/)
6. 12 Month RSI > 90 [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/Wf6Nuiof-BTC-USD-12-month-RSI/)
7. 3-month coin days destroyed - check glassnode, STH and LTH [chart](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&category=&m=indicators.Cdd90AgeAdjusted)

# Summary

1. S2F model suggests a peak around the beginning of 2021Q4, in the region of **&#36;300,000**.
1. The rainbow chart seems to broadly agree with S2F.
1. If the age-adjusted 3-month coin days destroyed goes above 550,000 then get ready to sell.
1. Willy Woos "double top" chart suggests a peak around **&#36;400,000**.
1. RationalRoot's comparison of bull runs suggests a market top around **14 September** and a maximum price around **&#36;2,000,000** [sic].
1. RationalRoot's comparison of 12 months RSI suggests that the market top is reached shortly after a **12 month RSI exceeds 90**. This seems less reliable than the above points
1. Jurrien Timmer suggests a peak price around &#36;100,000 if price shoots up unexpectedly quickly. I expect the market top to be significantly higher.
1. &#36;100k will be a massive psychological level. If the price does increase to this level before approximately July then the optimal sell price would therefore not be exactly &#36;100,000.
1. Market top is expected around **September 2021 at the earliest**.
1. The behaviour of the market will change as its participants change. There hasn't been a bull run with significant institutional investors before.
1. Sell using a cost averaging strategy.

## Awareness

- Buy when everyone is selling, sell when everyone is buying. Be brave when there is fear, if there is no fear then its about to get very messy.
- If everyone is super confident that prices are definitely going to go up, something bad is about to happen. A lack of uncertainty is a big warning bell.
- **14 September, &#36;300,000.**

# Threshold Values

## MVRV

- MVRV > 3 → Local top
- MVRV > 4 → Macro top
- MVRV has historically been one of the best on-chain predictors of market tops and bottoms.
- The ratio of Market Value to Realised Value is calculated by dividing Bitcoin’s market cap by its realised cap.
- [chart](http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-price-models/)

## Top Cap

- Top Cap is 35 x Average Cap
- Market top when Top Cap is equal to Market Cap.

## Delta Cap

- Delta cap is Average Cap subtracted from Realised Cap.
- When Delta Cap is almost Realised Cap, it's a market top.
- When Delta cap touches Average Cap, it's a market bottom.
- Market Top when Delta cap is within 20%­15% of Realised Cap

## S2F Deflection

- Get key ratio values
- If s2F deflection > 3, but its [noisy](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&category=&m=indicators.StockToFlowDeflection)

## HODL Waves

- \>45% of supply has been moved in the last 180 days (6 months) → Sell
- \>70% of supply has been held over 180 days → Buy
- [chart](https://unchained-capital.com/hodlwaves/) - hover the cursor over todays date and add up all the age brackets from 24hr to 3-6 months

## 12 month RSI > 90

- 14 month RSI > 95 → Sell
- 12 month RSI > 90 → Sell
- Noisy - defer to other metrics.

## SOPR

- Use 7 day average.
- 1.04 → Sell
- 0.97 → Buy
- Noisy - defer to other metrics.

## Realised Cap > NVT Cap

- Realised Cap should be lower than NVT Cap.
- Sell when Realised Cap almost exceeds NVT cap
- See chart below, there have been false positives.
- Realised Cap is lower than NVT cap during a bull market only.
- Noisy, could be a miss.

# Key metrics and terms

## Average Cap

The "forever" moving average of market cap. It is the cumulative sum total of
daily market cap values divided by the age of the market in days.

## Top Cap

Average Cap multipled by 35.

## NVT Cap

A valuation using monetray velocity. Checkout CoinMetrics for more info.

## MVRV

The ratio of Market Value to Realised Value is calculated by dividing Bitcoin's
market cap by its realised cap.

## Realised Cap

The sum of the products of each UTXO and the market price of Bitcoin when the UTXO was generated.

## Market Cap

The price of the most recent Bitcoin transaction multipled by the number of Bitcoin

## UTXO

_Unspent Transaction Outputs_. These are kind of like unspent coins. If you have
1.5 BTC then you might have bought 2 and sold 0.5. The total value of UTXOs in
your wallet will be 1.5.

## SOPR

The _Spent Output Profit Ratio_ is a measure of the average profit or loss on a
coin. Is a coin is moved when the price is higher than when it was received the
SOPR increases, if a coin is moved when the price is lower than when the coin
was received then SOPR decreases.

It won't be accurate for individual coins but in aggregate it gives an idea of
whether coins are being sold at a loss or for profit.

Market participants who have owned BTC for 3 months behave differently to those
that have held BTC for 3 years. A more experienced investor will likely make
more measured and less rash decisions.

By segregating the UTXOs according to age you can compare old coins and new
coins, experienced and inexperienced investors (in aggregate).

Weak hands will sell before stronger hands, and when market price decrease it's
useful to know aggregate age data for the coins being sold. If coins are moving
from young wallets then the selling is likely much less significant than if
coins are being moved onto exchanges from old wallets.

## aSOPR

The _Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio_ is the same as SOPR but it ignores
coins less than 1 hour old.

If profits are taken by old coins, aSOPR trends higher. It will trend lower
when older (and therefore profitable) coins remain dormant.

The higher aSOPR is, the more profit has been taken off the table.

When aSOPR is less than 1, spent coints are moved at an aggregate loss.

## URPD

_UTXO Realised Price Distribution_ - If a lot of coins have moved within a
particular price band, it is likely that there is strong price support and
resistance at this price.

This would be truer and more reliable in a mature market. Because the market
for Bitcoin is expanding so rapidly and the price is so volatile, the attitudes
and expectations of market participants is also much more malleable than in
traditional finance. For example, what was considered a very high price 12
months ago would be considered a disaster today.

## RSI

The _Relative Strength Index_ is borrowed directly from traditional finance.
You can calculate it over different time periods.

## Miner Net Position

_Miner Net Position_ shows the degree to which, on aggregate, Bitcoin miners
are profiting from the coins they've generated from mining. Miners are expected
to be among the most bullish of all market participants, and therefore it is
notable when they start moving coins from their mining wallets into exchange
wallets.

## Stock-to-Flow

A stock to flow model is used to measure the scarcity of a commodity. It's a
calculation based on the ratio of existing supply and how much
is being produced. The higher the ratio, the longer it will take for supply
to meet existing demand.

Gold has a stock to flow ratio of 66, which means it would take 66 years at
the current rate of production to produce the amount of gold currently in
circulation. Silver has a S2F ratio of 74. BTC has a S2F of about 50.

# Background

Over the past 8 years, Bitcoin has gone through phases of rapid price increase
followed by periods of rapid decrease. The price has been driven by increasing
market size and a decreasing rate of issuance, and has been so volatile
(compared to traditional finance) that "1 month in cryptocurrency markets is
like 1 year in traditional markets". However volatility is decreasing and we
are seeing lower highs and higher lows during each subsequent market cycle.

The single biggest factor driving multi-year market cycles appears to be the
decreasing rate of supply increase (the issuance rate). The last 3 halvings[ref]Every 210,000
blocks, the number of bitcoin awarded to the miner for successfully adding a
block is halved. The last halving occurred in May 2020 and the rate of issuance
halved from 12.5 BTC/block to 6.25 BTC/block[/ref] seem to have provoked the last
3 bull cycles. We are in the third bull cycle now (April 2021) and I fully
expect it to be followed by a bear cycle.

As an amateur investor, I want to buy low and sell high. I'd like to time the
top and bottom of the market with reasonable accuracy, just like everyone else.
But I'm aware that my methods are less nuanced than professional traders and
analysts - I have access to less data than them and I'm not willing to put in
as much effort as they are. I'm happy to do this
[Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) style - I'll give it
20% of my maximum effort and I'll be happy with 80% of an ideal result[ref]I
realise this probably isn't, strictly, what Mr. Pareto was thinking when he
published his research. I hope you get my intention.[/ref].
