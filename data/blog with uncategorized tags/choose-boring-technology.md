I'm surprised I haven't posted this before because the "choose boring tech" article
by Dan McKinley made a big impression when I first read it, about 3 years ago.

1.  [original article](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)
2.  [humorous slide show version](http://boringtechnology.club/)

Key takeaways, based on my memory of reading it a couple years ago:

- Boring tech is that which is mature enough and that you know well enough that
  you are familiar with its shortcomings, and that will let you build
  something quickly
- You get 3 innovation tokens for each project or stack. Choosing some new and
  exciting bit of tech requires spending 1 of those tokens.
- A nice alternative title for this is "How to be old, for young people", which
  is really incisive.
- In addition to the advice in the article, I read somewhere else that the
  probability of something continuing to exist in future, and be actively maintained and
  supported, is approximately the amount of time that it has already
  existed, and been supported and maintained. I'm not even sure that makes
  sense, but it bears considering. Source?

This should be on my imaginary list of "things I should read every couple of
years". Actually, a few lists might be really useful. A list of python articles,
a list of advice articles, etc. It would be similar to the books page, which is just a
list of book articles.
