I know about [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com/), which used to be great because you could do a lot for
free, but now you only get 1 domain for free.

[ForwardEmail](https://forwardemail.net) are 3 times cheaper than ImprovMX, and
I have 2 domains forwarding email. It's not particularly private, but I can send
and recieve from a domain, for free.
