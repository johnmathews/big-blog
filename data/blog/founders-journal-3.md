- Built the backend!
- Decided to stick with what I knew, and build using Django.
- Decisions look obvious in retrospect

- User authentication is functional
- Document upload, storage, retrieval is functional
- Data gets passed to the front
- Still need to write tests

- I've learnt a lot of Django in the last 2 weeks, and it feels good to have gained some proficiency there.
- I've got momentum, that’s great.
- I've put in a lot of intense focussed days
- I need to pace myself better, it’s tiring.
- What’s next:
- Front end
  - Basic site design
  - Some static pages
  - Dashboard viz - d3, I guess.
