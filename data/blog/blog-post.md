A [blog
post](https://edbrsk.dev/content/real-cases/how-I-compromised-300-stores-and-a-spanish-consultancy)
about how someone compromised a group of web apps.

It lists a series of technologies and techniques that the author uses as they
progress their investigation.

These would make a useful list of things to know in order to build safe web-apps
and not repeat the mistakes of the unfortunate target company.
