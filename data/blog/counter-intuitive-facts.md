Thanks to [Alexander Kruel](https://substack.com/profile/2149674-alexander-kruel) for this list:

1. It is possible to compute over encrypted data without access to the secret
   key [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption).

1. If customers take on average 10 minutes to serve and they arrive randomly at
   a rate of 5.8 per hour then the waiting time for one teller is five hours
   while the waiting time for two tellers is 3 minutes
   [(source)](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/10/21/what-happens-when-you-add-a-new-teller/).

1. There exists a set of three dice, A, B, and C, with the property that A rolls
   higher than B more than half the time, and B rolls higher than C more than
   half the time, but it is not true that A rolls higher than C more than half
   the time [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontransitive_dice).

1. Causation does not imply correlation

   of circle B, and circle A rolls one trip around circle B. How many times will
   circle A revolve in total? [(source)](youtube.com/watch?v=kN3AOMrnEUs))

1. There is a surface that has only one side

1. Given a solid ball in 3‑dimensional space, there exists a decomposition of
   the ball into a finite number of disjoint subsets, which can then be put back
   together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original
   ball: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox

1. A system cannot change while you are watching it:

1. In two dimensions, there are infinitely many regular polygons. In three
   dimensions, there are five Platonic solids. In four dimensions, there are six
   platonic polychora. In all higher dimensions than four, there are only ever
   three regular polytopes. (Maths 1001, Richard Elwes)

1. There are as many whole positive numbers as all fractions (including the
   whole negative and whole positive numbers).

1. There is a shape with a finite volume but an infinite surface area (Gabriel’s
   Horn). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%27s_Horn

1. There are infinite sets that can be exhaustively searched over in finite
   time:

1. Any positive rational number x can be written as a finite sum of distinct
   numbers of the form 1/n. (Calculus, 4th edition by Michael Spivak)

1. Let alpha = 0.110001000000000000000001000..., where the 1's occur in the n!
   place, for each n. Then alpha is transcendental. (Calculus, 4th edition by
   Michael Spivak)

1. There are sequences of numbers which grow unimaginably enormous and continue
   for an unimaginably long number of terms...but which always eventually get
   back down to zero. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodstein%27s_theorem

1. The vast majority of real numbers can't be described. But it is impossible to
   give a single example.

   tails => -1) then the probability they're linearly independent is at least
   1-(1/2 + o(n))^n. I.e., they're very very likely independent!"
