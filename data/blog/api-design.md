Some super brief notes I made about API design:

## Background

- It's more of an art than a science
- RESTful (REpresentational State Transfer) API design is an architectural style.
- Alternative API architectures:
  - SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a heavier style.
  - `GraphQL` - doesnt overfetch. Graph query language made by Facebook.
- APIs are everywhere (not just web APIs). They're an [abstraction](/blog/principles-of-oop#2-abstraction) that hides an implementation. `Django` model managers are an API (and also part of Django's ORM), JavaScript is an API, etc.

## RESTful APIs

- Web APIs (all REST APIs?) expose a databases to clients
- A rest api is a URL route (endpoint) that returns JSON or XML.
- POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, corresponds to Create, Read, Update/Replace, Update/Modify, Delete (HTTP methods correspond to CRUD methods)
- HTTP METHODS:
  - PUT (create or update) is idempotent, POST is not idempotent (keep on creating, updating)
  - PATCH - partial update
  - GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE methods are idempotent cos they are only designed for retrieving data.
  - DELETE
  - HEAD - almost identical to GET, but without any body. Good for checking what a request would return, i.e. Before downloading a large amount of data,
  - OPTIONS - returns data describing what other methods and operations the server supports at the given URL. More loosely defined than other verbs.

## Qualitative Advice

- Use HTTP verbs to make requests more meaningful
- Use sensible resource names. Naming things is hard, so think about this a bit
  before starting.
  - Use identifiers in your URLs, not the query string.
    - **Good**: `/users/12345`
    - **Poor**: `/api?type=user&id=23`
- Use the hierarchical structure of the URL to imply the structure of the API.
- Design (names and structure of things) for the user/client, not for the database.
  - Resource names should be nouns not verbs
  - Use plurals consistently, not collection verbiage. Good: customers/123 Bad: customer_list/123
  - Use case-insensitivity.
  - Use camel case or snake case consistency
  - Short is better than long, but be clear
  - Spend time on design before writing code
- Use HTTP response codes to indicate status
- Prefer JSON over XML. (Hotline does HTML..)
- XML requires schemas for validation and namespaces. Donâ€™t support this complexity at the beginning (or ever) unless required. If it is required, make the XML as similar to JSON as possible.
- Put links in the HTTP link header, or use a JSON representation of this.
- Use the HTTP location header to contain a link on resource creation, or for GET with pagination, use first, last, next, prev.
- Connectedness - return links in the response which link to useful resources. At minimum, a link to show how the data was received, or posted.
- Idempotence - clients making the same repeated requests create the same result on the server side. I.e. making repeated requests has the same result as making a similar request, server side. On the client side, a response code may change, of course.
