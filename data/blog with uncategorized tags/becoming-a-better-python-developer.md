I've been subscribed to Aaron Maxwell's "Powerful Python" newsletter for over a
year and I really like it. His emails are opinionated and candid, and
singularly focussed. He seems passionate about what he does and I like that.

Ultimately, the emails are designed to drive sign-ups for his courses which I
suspect would be very good, but there is a lot of value in the free emails.
Thanks Aaron. I realised that the emails are sequential and each subscriber
gets the same sequence of messages regardless of when they signed up. There is
the 'first' message, and then the 'second', and they kind of progress and flow.

This means that there are more benefits to paying attention than for usual
email subscriptions. Even though the emails arrive when I'm at a
supermarket, or making dinner for my kids, it's good to try and read it
properly later.

After being subscribed for several months, I unsubscribed and resubscribed. Now
that I know how reliable and high quality this advice is I'm going to
prioritise working through the examples and doing some of what I missed the
first time. I've gone back to the beginning to reinforce the parts I know and
to try again with what eluded me the first time.

Three kinds of practice projects to become a better developer:

1. A web app - use `Django` if you don't know which framework to user. Done
   this.
2. A command line tool - use the `argparse` module, because it's in the standard
   library. Haven't done this yet, I guess now is a good time to start. It
   seems like the simplest and quickest of the three kinds of project, and I
   can see how useful it could be - it lets you use the app in many different
   contexts, outside the python eco-system and anywhere command line tools can
   be used (everywhere).
3. A machine learning model - I've already studied this, from theory (`numpy`)
   to frameworks (`tensorflow`). I'm happy to see it's included.
