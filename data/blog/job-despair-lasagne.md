A [blog article](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/most-data-work-seems-fundamentally-worthless/) that
overlaps with a few ideas and feelings I've been trying to pin down.

Compare it to ["A project of ones own"](http://paulgraham.com/own.html) by Paul Graham.

What I like about this article is that the author has managed to speak to others and advance his
understanding of the problems and various solutions - I have not. I also like the honesty and frank
nature of the writing.

- I want to prioritise meaningful work and a balanced lifestyle above being financially rich and
  stressed.
- It's important to me to create something useful.
- My work needs to have meaning.
- Normal isn't OK.

I've been thinking about non-profit work, or academia. After reading this, I'm more likely to
consider academia.

A related blog post: [Goodbye, Data Science](https://ryxcommar.com/2022/11/27/goodbye-data-science/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)

- the author trades data science for data engineering
- does publicising a view make it more likely that others will publish similar views?
