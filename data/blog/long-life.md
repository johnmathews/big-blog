---

An [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125071/)[^4] in the
American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine identified 5 places where people
routinely live more than 100 years[^2]. People in these communities are 10x more
likely to reach 100 than someone in the USA.

The paper references a study that reported that on average only 20% of someones ability to live
to 100 is dictated by genes, the other 80% is due to lifestyle[^1].

## 9 Factors for long life

The nine factors that each of the five geographic communities had in common are:

1. **Move naturally**. The world’s longest-lived people do not pump iron, run
   marathons, or join gyms. Instead, they live in environments that constantly
   nudge them into moving without thinking about it. They grow gardens and do not
   have mechanical conveniences for house and yard work.

2. **Purpose**. The Okinawans call it Ikigai and the Nicoyans call it plan de vida;
   for both, it translates to “why I wake up in the morning.” Knowing your sense of
   purpose is worth up to 7 years of extra life expectancy.

3. **De-Stress**. Even people in the Blue Zones experience stress. Stress leads to
   chronic inflammation, associated with every major age-related disease. What the
   world’s longest-lived people have that others do not are routines to shed that
   stress. Okinawans take a few moments each day to remember their ancestors;
   Adventists pray; Ikarians take a nap; and Sardinians do happy hour.

4. **80% Rule**. The 20% gap between not being hungry and feeling full could be
   the difference between losing weight or gaining it. People in the Blue Zones eat
   their smallest meal in the late afternoon or early evening, and then, they do
   not eat any more the rest of the day.

5. **More Plants, Less Meat**. Beans, including fava, black, soy, and lentils, are the
   cornerstone of most centenarian diets. Meat—mostly pork—is eaten on average only
   5 times per month. Serving sizes are 3 to 4 oz, about the size of a deck of
   cards.

6. **Wine, daily**. People in all Blue Zones (except Adventists) drink alcohol
   moderately and regularly. Moderate drinkers outlive nondrinkers. The trick is to
   drink 1 to 2 glasses per day (preferably Sardinian Cannonau wine), with friends
   and/or with food. And no, you cannot save up all week and have 14 drinks on
   Saturday.

7. **Church**. All but 5 of the 263 centenarians interviewed belonged to some
   faith-based community. Denomination does not seem to matter. Research shows that
   attending faith-based services 4 times per month will add 4 to 14 years of life
   expectancy.

8. **Family first**. Successful centenarians in the Blue Zones put their
   families first. This means keeping aging parents and grandparents nearby or in
   the home (it lowers disease and mortality rates of children in the home too.).
   They commit to a life partner (which can add up to 3 years of life expectancy)
   and invest in their children with time and love. (They’ll be more likely to care
   for aging parents when the time comes.)

9. **Friends**. The world’s longest lived people chose—or were born into—social
   circles that supported healthy behaviors, Okinawans created moais—groups of 5
   friends that committed to each other for life. Research from the Framingham
   Studies shows that smoking, obesity, happiness, and even loneliness are
   contagious. So the social networks of long-lived people have favorably shaped
   their health behaviors.

## Blue Zones in Europe

### Sardinia (Italy)

Located off the coast of Italy, Sardinia is home to the world’s longest-lived
men. This community of shepherds walk 5 mountainous miles a day or more. This
natural movement provides all the positive cardiovascular benefits you might
expect and also has a positive effect on muscle and bone metabolism without the
point pounding of running marathons. The classic Sardinian diet is plant based,
consisting of whole-grain bread, beans, garden vegetables, and fruits. Meat is
largely reserved for Sundays and special occasions. Sardinians drink wine
moderately. Cannonau wine has 2 or 3 times the level of artery-scrubbing
flavonoids as other wines. Moderate wine consumption may help explain the lower
levels of stress among men.

### Ikaria (Greece)

People on this tiny Aegean island live 8 years longer than Americans do. They
experience 20% less cancer, half the rate of heart disease, and almost no
dementia. Ikarians eat a variation of the Mediterranean diet, with lots of
fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, potatoes, and olive oil. Ikarians
also downshift with a mid-afternoon break. People who nap regularly have up to
35% lower chances of dying from heart disease. It may be because napping lowers
stress hormones or rests the heart. One Ikarian in particular, Stamatis
Moraitis, moved to America when he was 22 years old to pursue the American
dream. He was a painter, and immediately started having success, bought a house,
married, and had 3 kids. At the age of 66 years, he developed terminal lung
cancer. Instead of dying in America, he decided to move back to Ikaria and moved
in with his parents. He started breathing the air, drinking the wine, and eating
a Mediterranean diet. After a few months, he planted a garden not planning on
ever getting to harvest the vegetables; 37 years later he has a vineyard
producing 200 litres of wine a year. His secret he says? “I just forgot to die.”
