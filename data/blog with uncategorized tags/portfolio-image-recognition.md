I've created a [computer vision
model]({filename}/pages/azure-image-recognition-demo.md) that recognizes
traffic lights. I've also created a page where the model can be queried and the
results shown. This needed to be a custom page and not a typical blog article,
so its hosted in the portfolio section
[here]({filename}/pages/azure-image-recognition-demo.md).

This page will redirect automatically if you view it in a browser, but for
those of you reading this using RSS, head on over and see the results!
