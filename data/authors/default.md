Hello! I'm a python developer and data scientist with a passion for building things with code.

This site is a mixture of my notes, a portfolio and a record of my hobbies and interests. It might
be morphing into a [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). It's a personal
project and somewhere I can experiment with web and cloud technologies.

Most of my work is as a freelance [data-scientist](https://python-blog.johnmathews.is/traffic.html).
I also do [web development](/blog/load-testing-web-analytics-tool) and <a
href="https://johnmathews.is/categories/technical/cryptocurrencies">blockchain</a> infrastructure
work. More information about my work can be found [here](/experience).
