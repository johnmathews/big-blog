The phenomenon of experts believing news articles on topics outside of their
fields of expertise, even after acknowledging that articles written in the same
publication that are within the experts' fields of expertise are error-ridden
and full of misunderstanding:

\*\*\*

[The] Media carries with it a credibility that is totally undeserved. You have all
experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I refer
to it by this name because I once discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by
dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect,
than it would otherwise have.)

Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the
newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case,
physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has
absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the
article is so wrong it actually presents the story backwardâ€”reversing cause and
effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's full of them.

In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a
story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as
if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the
baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I'd point out it does not operate in other
arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies
to you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal
doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one
part, untruthful in all. But when it comes to the media, we believe against
evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper.
When, in fact, it almost certainly isn't. The only possible explanation for our
behavior is amnesia.
