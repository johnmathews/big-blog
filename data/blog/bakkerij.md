I recently began working in a new coworking space, sharing an office unit with another entrepreneur. What makes this coworking space unique is it's conversion from an industrial bakery to a coworking space. Where the machinery once stood, converted shipping containers with glass walls have become offices for startups and freelancers.

The skylights, glass walls and bright colors create a light and airy atmosphere, and the space seems popular with designers and founders working in creative industries. It's an energetic space with a creative feel to it.
