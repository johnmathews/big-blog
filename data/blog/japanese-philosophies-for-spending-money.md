## Chisoku

Being content with what you already have. You don't need more stuff, or new
stuff, just because it exists. You're being _marketed at_, or _marked_.

Do you need it or do you want it? Need is finite, want is infinite.

## Wabi Sabi

Beauty in imperfection. As things begin to wear, they develop some character
that can make them nicer than something that is fresh. It's the opposite of _new
shiny thing syndrome_.

## Mitate

An object has more than one purpose. Repurposing, inventing, adapting, etc is
interesting and a mini achievement that can be celebrated.
