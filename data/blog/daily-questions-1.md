This is an attempt to make a habit that encourages me to think for myself, form my own ideas and set
my own agenda.

Rather than starting my day be reading or watching whatever an editor or algorithm puts on the front
page, I would like to write down a few questions. These are likely the minutia of a day that will
soon be forgotten:

1. What will be the topic of my first YouTube video?
2. Is my knee going to get better, or do I need to change something?
3. How am I going to carve out time during my work day to enforce a more productive structure - for
   myself and my clients.
