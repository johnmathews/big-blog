A [blog post](https://stkbailey.substack.com/p/elitism-as-the-mid-career-growth) by Stephen Bailey
articulating something I've thought about but never seen anyone else consider:

> The active and violent spirit of the postdoc is a critical difference in the ways that early- and
> mid-career professionals grow in their craft.

> It takes animus to push conversations out from the boring straits of explanation and pedantry and
> into the frothy, conflicting waves of exploration and world expansion. It takes a bit of pirate
> swagger. It takes a separation of the world into mateys and landlubbers.

> After the beginner’s scaffolding of skills, what matters is the mechanism for deciding what’s
> next. That’s where opinion and aversion — not reason! — comes in.
