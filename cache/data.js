      '\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Marketing has three phases\n\n- Before (prospect) - get people to know you and indicate interest\n- During (lead) - get the to like you and buy from you for the first time\n- After (customer) - get them to trust you, buy from you regularly, and refer\n- new customers\n\nMarketing is _strategy_, all the other things are _tactics_\n\n### Jargon free definition of marketing\n\n- **Advertising** - The circus is coming to town, you paint a sign saying "Circus coming to town on Saturday"\n- **Promotion** - Put the sign on the back of an elephant and walk it into town\n- **Publicity** - Walk the elephant through the mayors flower beds and let a newspaper write about it\n- **Public relations** - Get the mayor to laugh about it\n- **Sales** - the town people go to the circus, you explain how much fun the entertainment is, they buy some tickets, you answer their questions, they spend lots of money on food, games, shows.\n- **Marketing** is the plan that made the whole thing happen\n',

      "\n\nPeople usually say that the bible is a collection of books, but some of the\nbooks are actually letters. Two of the letters were written by Peter, who was\none of Jesus' disciples. \"1 Peter\" is the first letter.\n\nThe other numbers are the chapters and verses. They're used to divide the text\nso that specific parts can be referred to easily. They're not part of the\noriginal text - chapters were introduced around the 13$^{th}$ century, and\nverses in the 16$^{th}$ century, apparently.\n\n$^{1}$<mark>To those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia,\nCappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of God the\nFather, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and\nfor sprinkling with his blood:</mark>\n\n<mark>May grace and peace be multiplied to you.</mark>\n\nThis is the start of a letter to a specific group of people. It's intended to be\nencouraging and dense from the very beginning. It is intended that the letter is\nremembered and paid attention to.\n\nThe sentence structure is awkward when its translated into modern English\nbecause its a translation. Presumably in the original language you could create\nlong statements with many clauses in them and people would be comfortable with\nthat. I'm unaware of the letter writing customs of the day, so maybe Peter is\nusing a very normal type of introduction, or maybe he is deliberately imitating\nthe style of a specific type of letter, or person.\n\nThe first sentence implies that exiles of the Dispersion (what dispersion? I\ndon't know.) are not exiles by accident. Even though I bet becoming exiled felt like an\nunplanned interruption to their life. The first sentence says that God chose\nthem, and that there is a purpose. There is a chain of reasoning that involves\nGod the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit - the trinity. One God in\nthree persons... I don't get it, I can't explain it, but I'm going to try and\nwork with this understanding.\n\n- According to the foreknowledge of God the Father →\n- in the sanctification of the Spirit →\n- for obedience to Jesus Christ and\n  for sprinkling with his blood\n\nIt's like 1 and 2 are requirements for 3, because \"for\" means \"the reason\nwhy something was done\".\n\nI should find out what \"sprinkling with his blood\" means, instead of guessing.\nClearly its a weird and gross idea...\n\nIt means... being marked by Jesus' blood. It seems clear enough that this is the\nblood that was spilt when he was sacrificially murdered, and it seems that the benefit or the\nreason why this would be desirable is already obvious to the readers. Having\nJesus' blood on you is to associate yourself with the benefits of that sacrifice\nas well as to count the cost of the sacrifice.\n\nIt's probably a line of reasoning that would be intuitive to believers with a\nJewish background if they've previously sacrificed animals in temples during\nvarious festivals. Is this letter written to a group of believers with a Jewish\n(rather than gentile) background?\n\nBack to the chain of reasoning: the foreknowledge of the Father and the\nsanctification of the Spirit is necessary for being associated with Jesus\nsacrifice and for being obedient to Jesus. That's a big conclusion from only the\nfirst sentence.\n\n<mark>May grace and peace be multiplied to you.</mark>\n\nI like that exhortation so much I could get it as a tattoo. Grace and Peace,\nbetter than fine dining and a comfortable bed. Also, chewing over the\nimplications of the previous sentence is enough to cause confusion and angst -\nso the exhortation is well timed. Chill - even though you've been exiled, you\nweren't planning on being a migrant, and God planned this for you, and this is\npart of your necessary sanctification in order to be associated with Jesus'\nsacrifice - you can be full of peace, and there is lots of grace (which is\nforgiveness, and patience, and maybe gentleness) available to you.\n\nNext sentence...\n",

      "\n\n<mark>Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace\nthat was to be yours searched and inquired carefully, inquiring what person or\ntime the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the\nsufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. It was revealed to them that\nthey were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been\nannounced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy\nSpirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.</mark>\n\nThe salvation that Peter is referring to is described\n[previously](1-peter-1-vs-3). He was encouraging us that\neven though our salvation is mysterious it is very valuable, and that the\ninexpressible joy that we feel is not unusual or a cause for concern. Don't be\nuncomfortable. Grace and peace.\n\nTo encourage us even more, Peter tells us that even the prophets (he implicitly\nassumes his readers are familiar with the prophets, so I guess they're\ndefinitely Jewish, as guessed in the first post in this series) searched\nfor understanding about our salvation.\n\nThey wanted to know who the Christ would be and when he would arrive. I guess\nthey initially thought they were doing this to satisfy their own curiosity\nbecause it had to be revealed to them that this was in fact a service to the\nsaints that would come after them.\n\nInterestingly, it says that it was the Spirit who predicted Christ's sufferings\nand the following glories. I would not have expected that the Spirit of God\nneeded to do any predicting about Christ's sufferings or glories. Are you even\nable to predict something if you're omnipotent?\n\nBack to the text, Peters says that things have been announced to us via those\nwho preached the good news to us by the Hold Spirit, who was sent from heaven.\n\nPreaching by the power or enabling of the Holy Spirit has revealed things to us\nthat angels long[ref]Long, or longed? I would have expected it to be \"longed to\nknow\", but its not. Does chronology get messed up from our perspective if the\nother party is outside of time?[/ref] to know. We don't know everything, and we\nstill have questions, but some of our questions are answered, some of them\ninexpressibly, and some of the things we find mysterious or uncomfortable are\nsupposed to be so until our salvation is complete. Grace and peace. Hang in\nthere, you're doing ok.\n",

      "\n\n<mark>May grace and peace be multiplied to you.</mark>\n\n**Part 1:** <mark>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his\ngreat mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the\nresurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is\nimperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's\npower are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in\nthe last time.</mark>\n\n**Part 2:** <mark>In this you rejoice, through now for a little while, if necessary, you\nhave been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your\nfaith - more precious that gold that perishes though it is tested by fire - may\nbe found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus\nChrist.</mark>\n\n**Part 3:** <mark> Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see\nhim, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled\nwith glory, obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your\nsouls.</mark>\n\nI thought that writing about 1 paragraph per post would be easy, maybe even too\nshort, but this is so dense that I'm not sure. The last three highlighted\nparagraphs are all one paragraph originally[ref]Originally in my English bible.\nDoes the original text even have paragraphs?[/ref] , I've just split them up to\nmake it easier to write about.\n\n# Part 1\n\nAfter Peter's greeting ([previous post](1-peter-1-1)), he\nstarts his letter by praising Father God - the Lord of Lords and King of Kings.\nPeter says that it is by God's mercy that we have been born again, and that we\nare able to enjoy a living hope. As soon as Peter says this he begins to explain\nhow, and he uses a chain or reasoning again like he did in his greeting.\n\nI'm going to try and paraphrase in order to make the text less dense and make\nits meaning more obvious:\n\n1.  Because of God's mercy, we have a hope that is alive and so significant it\n    is as if we have been reborn. Our life is new, reset, fundamentally\n    different.\n1.  This is a direct result of Jesus dying and resurrecting.\n1.  The living hope seems to be hoping (or trusting) in the inheritance which is\n    promised but not yet received. The inheritance is described as:\n\n    1. Imperishable - cannot be destroyed.\n    1. Undefiled - cannot be made dirty, less pure, less valuable.\n    1. Unfading - doesn't get old or less good as time passes. It doesn't\n       diminish.\n    1. Kept in heaven for you - deliberately reserved in heaven for you, in particular.\n\n1.  By God's power, you are being guarded until your salvation.\n1.  This protection is received via your faith. Protection comes through your\n    faith. Not because of it, or from it, but through it.\n1.  The purpose of the protection is to keep you safe until your salvation,\n    which will only be revealed to you in the last time. Your salvation is\n    mysterious, because it hasn't been revealed yet. This last point is\n    itself mysterious.\n\n# Part 2\n\n_The tested genuineness of your faith is more precious than gold._ Not just the\ngenuineness, integrity, or sincerity of your faith, but the tested sincerity of your faith.\n\nThis tested sincerity is more precious than gold. Your faith is contrasted with gold that will\neventually decompose - even really high quality gold that is ultra refined. But\nyour tested and sincere faith is more resilient and more valuable than gold.\n\nThe process that creates a tested and genuine faith in Jesus is therefore to be\nappreciated, because of the end result. If you have a living hope of an\ninheritance through Jesus resurrection, then rejoicing would be a good\nresponse even if it is causing you grief and many trials.\n\nThe trials and grief will ultimately result in praise and glory and honor during the\nrevelation (revealing?) of Jesus Christ. I'm not sure if this is glory and honor\nfor Jesus, or for the person who has a tested and genuine faith. Maybe both?\n\n# Part 3\n\nI don't know if this passage is instructional or reassuring, or both. I guess\nit's both at the same time - you should love him, even though you've never seen\nhim. And also, don't feel uneasy about having never seen him. It's unusual to\nlove someone you've never seen, but in this situation it's normal. Don't worry.\nGrace and peace.\n\nThe same goes for inexpressible joy - you're hope in Jesus, his resurrection,\nand your coming resurrection makes you happy in ways that you didn't expect and\ncan't really articulate or explain - this is ok! It is more than ok - it is\nevidence of the sincerity and truthiness of your faith and is expected.\nBelieving in someone you've never seen, and loving someone you've never seen is\ngoing to result in you obtaining salvation. It's unusual, and different, but\ndon't worry. Grace and peace.\n",

      "\n\n4 years ago I started learning how to code, and it was difficult! It still is\ndifficult, but I now have a collection of tools and perspectives that make it\nless daunting. Leveling up requires one more abstraction\nto wrap my head around, or one more API to understand. I can do it.\n\nBut I don't think it needed to be so difficult, so now I'm building [Code\nSchool Meta](https://codeschoolmeta.com) to make it easier to learn how to\ncode.\n\nLearning to code has been fun, ultimately successful, and life changing (hello\njob security!) but at the beginning it was sooo slow, and super tricky.\n\nImposter syndrome is real, and I definitely felt it. I hadn't taken any classes\nin computer science, and I felt like I knew almost nothing about anything.\n\nThe process began with Pandas, a (_the_) Python analytics library. Spreadsheets\nwere slowing me down at work, and I was bored. I found this [great\ntutorial](https://youtu.be/5JnMutdy6Fw) by Brandon Rhodes. From there I found\nout about Jupyter Notebooks, and then I found about Github pages and how to\nmake a blog using [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).\n\nThat led to HTML and CSS (and also JavaScript, which I tried very hard to avoid\nfor as long as possible). I felt like a monkey bashing a keyboard as I tried to\nmake HTML elements do what I wanted.\n\nUnusally, I think Git was next. Mainly because I found this [amazing\ntutorial](git) to help me learn. It made Git seem OK,\nand also helped HTML and CSS make more sense too. Bonus!\n\nI suddenly realized that great learning materials are crucial if I was going to\nkeep momentum and keep on enjoying the thrill of seeing the computer do\nsomething I hadn't made it do before.\n\nSo now I'm now working on [Code School: Meta](https://codeschoolmeta.com). It's\nan online community to make it easier to teach yourself how to code - less\nconfusion about how to get started or what to learn next, more encouragement,\nand lots of high quality resources.\n\nIf you'd like to know more, please [check it out](https://codeschoolmeta.com)\nand sign up for updates.\n",

      "\n\nWhen working with more data than can fit in an Excel file, or when you\nwant to be sure the data won't be edited, you usually need to interact with\nthe data by writing scripts.\n\nOne of the biggest time sinks (for me) when working with these tools\n(ACL, SQL, Python) is debugging, and working out exactly where in the\nchain of individual commands something unexpected happened. Even with\nonly a modest page of code, I can quickly find myself rerunning the\nentire script multiple times and commenting-out and uncommenting\nmultiple lines in order to understand what's really going on. If you\nhave a time consuming task at the start of your script, such as a\nsummarise and sort command, the extra time required can be even greater.\nThis leads to interrupted flow and concentration.\n\nPandas is a python package to manipulate large datasets, the Jupyter\nnotebook is an application which allows the user to run a python script\nin chunks, and output the results of each chunk before continuing. You\ncan re-run a previous chunk without returning to the beginning, and\nchange the code as you go along. This is amazingly flexible and\nintuitive.\n\nI recently worked through an exceptionally good Pandas tutorial recorded\nat PyCon 2015. \"[Pandas from the ground\nup](https://youtu.be/5JnMutdy6Fw)\" is well structured, clear, has good\nscope and the resources are available to download from\n[github](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial).\nBrandon Rhodes gives you a good working foundation for using Pandas and\nthe Jupyter notebook to manipulate datasets using Python.\n",

The solution is to increase the tiny_magic variable at build time.\n\nAccording to the Readme, this requires using a container and building the index\nusing `docker run...`. Unfortunately the Dockerfile wouldn't complete without\nerrors. Checking the issues again and adding to the discussion resulted in an\nalternative Dockerfile being suggested, which works. Woohoo! I could then build\nthe search index with a massive tiny_magic value (2048).\n\nThen something weird happened. I write in Vim and I use `fzf` to find and open\nfiles. I realised that `fzf` had stopped working. After some investigating, I\nrealised it was only not working in the blog project, and that `fzf.vim` calls\nthe `fzf` CLI tool, which in turn calls the `ripgrep` tool. The underlying\nissue was that `ripgrep` wasn't working, and after a few hours (sob) of\ndebugging, I found out that one of the things that makes `rg` special is that\nit ignores stuff in your .gitignore file. Sneakily, and without me noticing,\nthe Docker image for constructing the tinysearch files had created a\n.gitignore file with a single entry. The entry was \\*, which selects\neverything. So `rg` was ignoring everything, and giving no results. Which\nmeant I couldn't find and open files.\n\nI still don't know how (or which part of) the Dockerfile does this, so I've\ncreated a .gitignore-master file which contains the correct content, and\nafter I generate a new search index I replace the new traitorous .gitignore\nwith the contents of .gitignore-master. I'll come back to it later\nwhen/if I have a better understanding of Dockerfile syntax, or Rust.\n\nAdding search to the site made the content feel a lot closer and more\naccessible. Once it was working I immediately wanted to use some keyboard\nshortcuts to open the search box and select results. Kind of like\n[tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/) does it. It feels really fast and\nprecise.\n\nGoogling for some jquery packages, and also some vanilla javaScript showed me\nenough to get things working. You can hit `/` or `ctrl-k` or `cmd-k` and bring up a search box\nthat populates results as you type!\n\nOnly whole words are matched unfortunately, but its still a super useful\nfeature. The search index includes article content as well as article titles\nand categories. I'd like to tweak a few of the keyboard shortcut behaviours,\nand add the contents of various pages (which aren't articles) to the search\nindex.\n\n## Update\n\nI've reimplemented search using `fuse.js`. You can read about it [here]({filename}../articles/fuse.md)\n",

    content:
      "\n\nOn April 3rd, I happened to be Googling digital currencies and blockchain\ninnovations when I came across the [Æternity website](http://www.Æternity.com)\nand skimmed their [white\npaper](https://blockchain.Æternity.com/%C3%A6ternity-blockchain-whitepaper.pdf).\nThe project is ambitious, like many crypto projects, but seems well organised.\nThe team is well known in the space. There is a clear plan to develop the\nproject and create a blockchain technology that, if successful, could bring. A\nstep change in the use of digital currencies for high volume low value\ntransactions, and the viable implementation of smart contracts.\n\n## The ICO\n\nTo my surprise, I realised that phase 1 of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was\nabout to begin, and if I wanted I could acquire the rights to Æons (the Æternity\ntoken). During phase 1, 1 ETH would purchase 1100 Æons. In early April 2017, 1\nETH was worth about £38.\n\nI was willing to make a small and risky investment, but in order to do that I\nwould need to work out how to convert my conventional Sterling into Bitcoin or\nEther, in order to then purchase Æons. The Æternity website made it super easy\nto set up an Etherium wallet, and to use that wallet to invest in the Æternity\nproject, but buying Ether immediately and putting it in my new wallet proved to\nbe challenging.\n\nHelpfully, the Æternity project had partnered with the Swiss firm 'Bitcoin\nSuisse AG' who would directly convert to Æons from fiat currencies, cutting out\nthe need to purchase an intermediate digital currency. However once I'd\ncompleted the identity checks and signed, scanned and sent the multiple forms, I\nrealised I'd need to pay a 'signing on' fee of about £70. To Bitcoin Suisse'\ncredit though, they did manually approve my identification and contract within\nan hour.\n\nAt the time, I thought the project would still be a good investment even with\nthis extra cost, but I determined to exhaust all other possibilities first. I'm\nfamiliar with cryptocurrency wallets and public/private keys due to some\n[previous research](encryption), so I was able to\nimmediately begin trying to set up an account with an exchange.\n\n## Exchanges\n\nWhat followed was a fairly chaotic few hours where I would sign-up to several\nexchanges and see how close I could get to purchasing either Bitcoin or Ether\nimmediately, before realising I either had to wait 48 hours for security\nclearances, or provide additional details, or wait for manual verification of my\nscanned identity documents.\n\nBy the end of the evening I had a rough idea of which usernames, passwords and\n(small) sterling amounts had been submitted to each exchange.\n\nAfter a couple of false starts, I used a combination of the\n[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) desktop website and their iOS app to\npurchase ETH up to their weekly limit, and then used multiple cards to increase\nmy holding of ETH. The Coinbase app would bug out when processing a debit card\npayment and verifying the card details with the bank. This had initially led me\nto try other exchanges, where I would hit other roadblocks and delays. CEX.IO,\nfor example, doesn't allow you to make trades in the first 48 hours (IIRC) after\nregistering, which is reasonable enough unless you're in a hurry.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOnce I had a few Ether to my name, the rest of the process was simple. I was\ndelighted to visit [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) and view the details of\nmy Etherium - Æternity transactions almost immediately. This gave me a lot of\nconfidence that I hadn't sent money into a void, and was a nice contrast to my\n(successful) experience buying bitcoin in early 2014.\n\nFinally, the simple tool to check your Æ balance at the bottom of Eternity's\n[contribution page](https://wallet.Æternity.com) assured me that I'd made my\ninvestment successfully. To me, the Æternity project stands as an exciting\nendeavor seeking to solve some widespread and highly valuable technical\nchallenges, I hope they're successful and wish them well.\n",

      '\n\nThese are my notes on the æternity blockchain project, I\'m not affiliated with the æternity team.\n\nÆternity is a new blockchain project that is pre-launch. The headline goal is to securely facilitate large volumes of smart-contracts which interface with external data sources. This is made possible via a decentralised oracle based on prediction markets. These terms are explained below. The æternity project has proposed several notable technical features:\n\n- Smart Contracts in state-channels\n- Oracles and native prediction markets\n- Governance by prediction markets\n- Written in Erlang\n- Different types of node\n- Sharding\n\n## Smart Contracts in state-channels\n\n- A smart contract is a way to execute a contract without an intermediary (middle-man) and without conflict.\n- The smart contract is a protocol which is stored and executed on a blockchain, executing transactions (outputs) based on specific inputs and programmable logic automatically. The logic often mirrors that contained in clauses of a written contract.\n- State channels are payment networks that exchange funds off-chain and periodically settle up accounts with the main blockchain. (The Bitcoin Lightning Network is creating a system for routing Bitcoin payments through state channels.)\n- State channels increase scalability by making groups of transactions independent of each other. This allows them to be processed in parallel.\n- æternity proposes executing smart-contracts in Turing-complete state channels (Turing complete means, colloquially, real-world and general purpose), which should allow greater volumes of transactions, and make the smart contracts more secure and easier to analyse.\n\n  This is because executing the smart-contracts off-chain makes them private and the code used to execute the smart contract won’t need to be broadcast to the primary blockchain. This should increase processing capacity by allowing contracts to execute in parallel.\n\n  Disadvantages to the state-channel approach include reduced transparency, as running smart contracts in state channels requires more trust in both the contract creator and the node running it.\n\n## Oracles and prediction markets\n\n- The Oracle functionality allows smart-contracts to interact with data outside the æternity blockchain. This is possible by checking on-chain prediction market results and rewarding users who made the correct prediction. Users are rewarded through automated payments and the immediate recording of transactions in the blockchain. This creates incentives to participate in prediction markets, which have been shown to be effective.\n- On-chain, rather than off-chain allows greater efficiency and integration\n- The prediction market is expected to run using a native (on-chain) consensus procedure. The oracle mechanism is designed to use the same consensus infrastructure.\n\n## Governance by prediction markets\n\n- Oracle functionality compliments prediction market functionality.\n- Prediction markets are proposed to implement governance of the æternity blockchain. This is a new approach.\n- The æternity protocol would be governed by user input. A prediction market will exist where changes to features and protocols would result in a higher token value.\n- The incentive to increase the value of a token (Æon) would allow the æternity community to decide efficiently which changes to implement.\n- Low level protocol changes to variables like block times and block capacity could be possible\n- The consensus developed by the prediction market will initially provide input to the development team’s decision-making.\n- Later, a fully autonomous prediction market for governance is expected (a DAO)\n\n## Written in Erlang\n\n- [Erlang](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)>) is normally used for large-scale systems that manage the allocation of scarce network resources (telecoms, banking, instant messaging)\n- Could make it easier to run a lightning network and process many state-channels in parallel\n- As far as I know, ÆTernity is the first blockchain project to be written in Erlang\n\n## Different types of node\n\n- The æternity network will contain nodes with different functions. Each type of node will contribute towards the efficient functioning of particular aspects of the network\n- Node types will include\n  - Liquidity - Lots of channels and lots of users. Open a channel to issue a contract, for a fee.\n  - Exchanges - Trustless exchanges of assets offered by market makers. Profitable to market makers because of transaction fees.\n  - Presumably features such as consensus algorithms and prediction markets will also require their own dedicated node types. Users of the node will incur transaction fees to participate, providing an incentive to run a node.\n\n## Sharding\n\n- Allows a greater transaction volume, removing scalability problems that Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced.\n- Sharding works by splitting the space of possible accounts into subspaces (for example based on the first digit of a numerical address)\n- Each shard gets a set of validators. Each validator validates 1 shard only\n- Contracts and transactions within the same shard work as normal\n- Contracts and transactions across shards require alternative techniques based on "transaction receipts"\n',

      "\n\nWhilst at the [Lisbon Investment Summit](http://www.lis-summit.com/) I went to a session called \"What it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe\" by [Oussama Ammar](https://twitter.com/daedalium?lang=en). I've written generally about the summit [here.](lis17)\n\nOussama spoke with passion and humour. It's clear that he cares about encouraging would-be founders and confronting some of the cultural hurdles that exist in Europe. These are my notes from the session:\n\n1. If you are serious about building something that matters then you have a great and exciting future ahead.\n2. You can never predict who will be successful and who will fail. There are a lot of dumb successful people and clever founders can fail.\n3. It's really important to learn how to leverage your time effectively. You can lose anything else and get it back but you can never recover the time you've already spent.\n4. The only way to succeed is to try hard.\n5. It's hard to do something that matters.\n6. In Europe you need to be more ambitious than average (measured against other countries) because the environment makes it harder to be an entrepreneur. (Attitudes to risk, comfort, security, expectations of failure.. are all unhelpful for founders.)\n7. It's not impossible, just harder. So be more ambitious.\n8. Everyone is replaceable, no-one is unique.\n9. You can always lose money and replace it. There is so much money in the world.\n10. Take a look at Crunchbase and see the failure rate for companies that raised $1m - $10m, it is the same rate for those that raised $10m+.\n11. If you lose money on a project you will learn things from that experience and you can leverage that learning\n12. … But you will never get back the time you spent.\n13. Zombies are companies that make enough money to survive but not enough to provide joy to the people in the company - aim high and…\n14. Starting a company is a big deal, like starting a marriage. Think hard about what you will be doing, what problem you are trying to solve, who you will be working with.\n15. In Europe there is not enough money to go around and this makes pitching hard. Silicon Valley doesn't have this problem.\n16. On average a startup in Europe will raise less than a startup in the USA.\n17. Europe is irrationally concerned about risk. USA is less concerned with risk and this is very helpful.\n18. So be pragmatic about risk.\n19. Incorporate in London where the laws are good, even if you don't want to operate in the UK. It has a better designed system of corporate law. Estonia is also good.\n\n## Best European city for founders\n\nLondon, Paris, Berlin..\n\n- There isn't a best city because none are holistic\n- London has the money\n- Paris has engineering and product development (and no-one outside Paris knows the products exist)\n- Berlin has automation and execution, execution and scaling\n\n…You need to draw on all 3 of these cities, which when taken together can surpass Silicon Valley.\n\n## Anecdotes\n\nThe founder of Slack lives in Vancouver with his wife and kids. He spends 1 day each week in California and everyone thinks Slack is Californian due to good marketing. Forget national pride, be pragmatic. Leverage the internet.\n\nThe founders of Airbnb would fly from New York to California for 1 day each week. They were originally in California where AirBnB started, but decided that if they could make it work in New York then AirBnB would be a success, so they moved to New York and flew back for meetings , etc. If you ask Europeans to come to a meeting in London (which is not as far as California is from New York) people start complaining and deciding they can't be bothered.\n",

      "\n\n# Background\n\nI've been spending a lot of time lately working on nodes for various blockchain\nprojects (Polkadot, Cardano, Tron, Binance Chain, Ethereum, ...). The rosetta\napi spec is super interesting, but like most things in crypto the documentation\nis sometimes wrong or incomplete and there are bugs and undocumented features.\n\nEach of the nodes runs on a separate server, and we typically have one node for\nmainnet and another for testnet. I'm working across mutiple servers, doing\ndifficult stuff, and I want it to be as easy as possible.\n\nI need to reduce friction and cognitive load.\n\nAccessing the servers is easy - I use Tmux with the\n[continuum](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum) and\n[resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect) plugins and\nmaintain different sessions for each type of server. This makes accessing\nmultiple servers during the same work day really simple and effortless. But\nworking on the servers is still awkward.\n\nOn my dev machine I have `zsh` with syntax highlighting, command completion,\nand various tools, like [z](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z) to make\nnavigation supper easy. I also have a lot of aliases defined. E.g. `..` → `cd ..`. Working on a remote server should be as convenient and familiar as working\non my local machine, so I want to find a way to configure a server the same way\nas my laptop, and I want to do it automatically so that it can be done many\ntimes, with no additional effort.\n\n# Ansible\n\nAnsible seems to be popular because:\n\n1. It's free\n2. It's got all the features and capabilities you're going to need\n3. It's agentless - you don't need to install anything on the machine you want\n   to control - you can use Ansible with anything that you can ssh into.\n\nI used the following resources to get started:\n\n- This [useful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9eCU4bGgjQ) gave me some\n  orientation and helped me figure out what I was aiming for and how to get\n  started. Before watching it, I didn't know \"which way was up\".\n\n- This [blog\n  post](http://matthieure.me/2018/12/31/ansible_inventory_plugin.html) showed\n  me how to create an inventory using the `gcp_compute` plugin.\n\n- I spent a lot of time being unnecessarily confused about service accounts.\n  I guess until you have 1 success at understanding something you don't know\n  if you've misunderstood by a little or a lot.\n\n- Once you have an inventory of servers that you want to connect to, you\n  still need to specify (and prepare for) how you will connect to them. I'd\n  hoped that the `gcp_compute` plugin would do some heavy lifting for me in\n  this step, but it seems not. It _can_ do lots of useful stuff like\n  creating instances and specifying disk space and networks, but it won't\n  really help you ssh into an instance. No matter though...\n\n- This [blog post](https://alex.dzyoba.com/blog/gcp-ansible-service-account/)\n  turned out to be just what I needed. I found it at the beginning of my\n  search when I was trying to create an inventory, and discarded it as almost\n  useful. Turns out that `OS Login` is the best way to ssh into a GCE\n  instance and once you've got your inventory taken care of, this blog post\n  really helps.\n\nWhen I was installing python modules, I had some errors about pyenv shims\nbeing incorrect. The scripts were looking for versions that weren't present.\nRunning `pyenv reshash` fixed it. Kind of magically, but annoying.\n\nSetting up a service account and giving it the correct permissions took more\ntime and was more confusing than anything to do with Ansible.\n\nI found this [blog post](https://www.arthurkoziel.com/setting-up-vim-for-yaml/)\nabout setting up vim for `yml` files.\n\nThe preferred way to install ansible on Mac is using `pip`.\n\nWhen you use `OS Login` the username you have when you ssh into the compute\ninstance will change. This [SO\nquestion](https://superuser.com/questions/1379434/google-compute-engine-ssh-different-username-after-switching-to-os-login)\nexplains why.\n\n# Commands\n\n- `gcloud auth list`\n- `ansible-config view|list|dump`\n- `ansible-inventory -i inventory.compute.gcp.yml --graph`\n- `ansible -i inventory.compute.gcp.yml all -m ping`\n",

    tags: ["uncategorized"],
    category: "Technical/Developer Tools",
    content:
      "\n\nSome super brief notes I made about API design:\n\n## Background\n\n- It's more of an art than a science\n- RESTful (REpresentational State Transfer) API design is an architectural style.\n- Alternative API architectures:\n  - SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a heavier style.\n  - `GraphQL` - doesnt overfetch. Graph query language made by Facebook.\n- APIs are everywhere (not just web APIs). They're an [abstraction]({filename}/articles/principles-of-oop.md#2-abstraction) that hides an implementation. `Django` model managers are an API (and also part of Django's ORM), JavaScript is an API, etc.\n\n## RESTful APIs\n\n- Web APIs (all REST APIs?) expose a databases to clients\n- A rest api is a URL route (endpoint) that returns JSON or XML.\n- POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, corresponds to Create, Read, Update/Replace, Update/Modify, Delete (HTTP methods correspond to CRUD methods)\n- HTTP METHODS:\n  - PUT (create or update) is idempotent, POST is not idempotent (keep on creating, updating)\n  - PATCH - partial update\n  - GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE methods are idempotent cos they are only designed for retrieving data.\n  - DELETE\n  - HEAD - almost identical to GET, but without any body. Good for checking what a request would return, i.e. Before downloading a large amount of data,\n  - OPTIONS - returns data describing what other methods and operations the server supports at the given URL. More loosely defined than other verbs.\n\n## Qualitative Advice\n\n- Use HTTP verbs to make requests more meaningful\n- Use sensible resource names. Naming things is hard, so think about this a bit\n  before starting.\n  - Use identifiers in your URLs, not the query string.\n    - **Good**: `/users/12345`\n    - **Poor**: `/api?type=user&id=23`\n- Use the hierarchical structure of the URL to imply the structure of the API.\n- Design (names and structure of things) for the user/client, not for the database.\n  - Resource names should be nouns not verbs\n  - Use plurals consistently, not collection verbiage. Good: customers/123 Bad: customer_list/123\n  - Use case-insensitivity.\n  - Use camel case or snake case consistency\n  - Short is better than long, but be clear\n  - Spend time on design before writing code\n- Use HTTP response codes to indicate status\n- Prefer JSON over XML. (Hotline does HTML..)\n- XML requires schemas for validation and namespaces. Don’t support this complexity at the beginning (or ever) unless required. If it is required, make the XML as similar to JSON as possible.\n- Put links in the HTTP link header, or use a JSON representation of this.\n- Use the HTTP location header to contain a link on resource creation, or for GET with pagination, use first, last, next, prev.\n- Connectedness - return links in the response which link to useful resources. At minimum, a link to show how the data was received, or posted.\n- Idempotence - clients making the same repeated requests create the same result on the server side. I.e. making repeated requests has the same result as making a similar request, server side. On the client side, a response code may change, of course.\n",

      '\n\nTwo small things have been learnt recently: the importance of PATH and\nthe contents of various BIN folders.\n\nAutumn 2016 has not gone as planned. Whilst studying for a couple of\nexams plans were put on hold and hobbies were ceased. Now that life is\nreturning to normal, I have opportunity to post again.\n\n## PATH\n\n<html>&#36;</html>PATH is a variable (string) which contains a series of folder\nlocations separated by ":". Each of these folders contains programmes.\nWhen you type the name of a programme into terminal without specifying\nits location, the OS looks sequentially in each of the folder locations\nlisted in <html>&#36;</html>PATH to see if the programme is there, and then executes\nit.\n\n## BIN\n\nBin as in Binary, not Bin as in Trash.\n\nThe bin folders contain binary files, which are programmes ready to be\nrun.\n\nIf I run "echo <html>&#36;</html>PATH" from the Terminal, I see 9 folders called bin,\nand its only by convention that they contain binaries. They are just\nnormal folders, which the OS is set to look in when asked to run an\napplication.\n\n    /Users/John/anaconda3/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/\n    3.5/bin:/Users/John/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/\n    Library/TeX/texbin\n',

He seems passionate about what he does and I like that.\n\nUltimately, the emails are designed to drive sign-ups for his courses which I\nsuspect would be very good, but there is a lot of value in the free emails.\nThanks Aaron. I realised that the emails are sequential and each subscriber\ngets the same sequence of messages regardless of when they signed up. There is\nthe 'first' message, and then the 'second', and they kind of progress and flow.\n\nThis means that there are more benefits to paying attention than for usual\nemail subscriptions. Even though the emails arrive when I'm at a\nsupermarket, or making dinner for my kids, it's good to try and read it\nproperly later.\n\nAfter being subscribed for several months, I unsubscribed and resubscribed. Now\nthat I know how reliable and high quality this advice is I'm going to\nprioritise working through the examples and doing some of what I missed the\nfirst time. I've gone back to the beginning to reinforce the parts I know and\nto try again with what eluded me the first time.\n\nThree kinds of practice projects to become a better developer:\n\n1. A web app - use `Django` if you don't know which framework to user. Done\n   this.\n2. A command line tool - use the `argparse` module, because it's in the standard\n   library. Haven't done this yet, I guess now is a good time to start. It\n   seems like the simplest and quickest of the three kinds of project, and I\n   can see how useful it could be - it lets you use the app in many different\n   contexts, outside the python eco-system and anywhere command line tools can\n   be used (everywhere).\n3. A machine learning model - I've already studied this, from theory (`numpy`)\n   to frameworks (`tensorflow`). I'm happy to see it's included.\n",

Practiced creating websites using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) web-framework\n\n2. Investigated and demo'ed [django-plotly-dash](https://pypi.org/project/django-plotly-dash/) - a library that allows exposing [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plot.ly) apps to django projects\n\n3. Built a personal finance dashboard using [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plot.ly) and began turning it into a web app using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and [django-plotly-dash](https://pypi.org/project/django-plotly-dash/).\n\n4. Interviewed for a role at [CoinMetrics.io](https://coinmetrics.io) and created [this investigation](https://blog.johnmathews.is/btc-fork-analysis.html) as a technical exercise.\n\n5. Created a company \"[Atlas Consulting Internatonal](https://atlasdata.nl)\" to facilitate life as a freelance data scientist and consultant.\n\n6. Spent a lot of time working at the cafe in IKEA because my co-working space wouldn't let me stay late or work on public holidays\n\n7. Introduced myself to this [new coworking space](http://haarlemoffice.nl) and suggested we could work together to create the best tech-focussed startup hub and coworking space in the Netherlands.\n\n8. Bought our first car. It required a lot more time and research than I expected.\n\n9. Created [Texni Data Consultancy](http://www.texnidata.com) with Dan Caputo to provide data strategy consultancy services.\n\n10. Built the website for [Texni Data](http://www.texnidata.com) using django and deployed it to Heroku with a custom domain name.\n\n11. Deployed a django app to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) using [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).\n\n12. Created a [business website](https://johnmathews.is) to represent my work as a freelance data scientist and made my [blog](https://blog.johnmathews.is) a subdomain of this site.\n\n13. Moved my blog off of github pages and onto [firebase](https://firebase.google.com). Thanks Github for several years of simple trouble free hosting.\n\n14. Experimented with using storage buckets on Google Cloud Platform to host static sites and serve them over SSL. My conclusion is that serving static sites using storage buckets is great - it's simple, quick and cheap (free). But adding SSL proved too difficult. I spent too many hours trying to create a loadbalancer that would work for both the root domain [johnmathews.is](https://johnmathews.is) and also a subdomain [blog.johnmathews.is](https://blog.johnmathews.is). In the end I found out about firebase. Firebase is also quick and cheap (free) and simple enough to pick-up quickly.\n\n15. Created a photo book using [PhotoBox](https://www.photobox.co.uk) that turned out great. It covers the last 3.5 years and is mostly full of snapshots of our kids and selfies with Ritsya.\n\n16. Chose a primary school for my daughter to go to next year.\n",

I used the `install.sh` script and went with\ndefault values as much as possible.\n\n# Installation\n\nMy first attempts to sync a full node used the `install.sh` script, but\nthe node wouldn't sync completely, it would get stuck. I setup a new VM and did\na manual install (\"Option Two\") and so far the node has been syncing without\nany issues. You need to download the genesis file separately in this\ncase. Also, be sure to download the `node-binary` repo using `git lfs` and not\njust `git`. It will look like it worked but `bnbchaind` wont have completely\ndownloaded unless you use `lfs`\n\nIt took me a while to realise that the documentation assumes that you have an\nenvironment variable called `BNCHOME`. You can either create it using\n\n```bash\nexport BNCHOME=/path/to/.bnbchaind/\n```\n\n(like you would for any environment variable) or replace the environment\nvariable in the start node command with the file path:\n\n```bash\nnohup bnbchaind start --home BNCHOME &\n```\n\nNote: I'm not sure if the `bnbchaind` needs the environment variable to be set\nor not. It doesn't give errors if it isn't set, but I seem to be having more\nsuccess when `BNCHOME` is defined.\n\n# Syncing the node\n\n- There are [three ways](https://docs.binance.org/guides/node/synctypes.html) to sync a node.\n- Fast-sync isn't the fastest way to sync your node, hot-sync is.\n- Using `install.sh` _should_ put the correct default values in the `$BNCHOME/config/config.toml` file, but I needed to adjust `ping_interval` and `pong_timeout` to the recommended values.\n\n# Surprises\n\nThe documentation assumes you have familiarity with running tasks in the\nbackground of a terminal session, and that you're familiar with `nohup`. I\nwasn't - I'd even forgotten what the `&` symbol does[ref]It starts a process in\nthe background. You can move it to the foreground with `fg` or see a list of\nrunning jobs using `jobs`. You can move a running job to the background (like a\nvim session) using `ctrl-z`[/ref] so I did some research and wrote some\n[notes](nohup-and-background-processes)\n",

Bitcoin cannot faciliate payments fast enough such that it could compete with Visa or Mastercard.\n\nThe most interesting solution to this problem is the [Lightning protocol](https://lightning.network/) - a separate protocol that sits ontop of the Bitcoin protocol (a so-called 'Layer 2' solution). Lightning uses hashed time locked contracts (HTLCs) to trustlessly and privately move transactions off-chain. This allows payments to be faster, cheaper and more frequent. It also has interesting implications for enhancing privacy.\n\nThere are a lot of resources about what the Lightning network is, why it's neccesary and how it works. There are also several good guides available about how to set up and maintain a node. I used a Raspberry Pi with an external hdd. It took a few attempts, mostly because it's my first time working with an unix operating system and I tried to move a swap file to a disk that wasnt formmated as ext4...\n\nAnyway, I've opened and closed some channels, connected to peers, and made some transactions. I even bought some stickers using Lightning!\n\nYou can find my node using these details:\n\n```zsh\nAlias: \"johnmathews.is\"\nPublic Key: \"025469b50de125b4cd97457c0da67365519f0cd0f441c2ced0978fb6ae7802ae76\"\nIP address: 85.145.183.145\nPort: 9735\n```\n\nSome useful resources:\n\n- [Lightning network explorer](https://explorer.acinq.co/n/025469b50de125b4cd97457c0da67365519f0cd0f441c2ced0978fb6ae7802ae76)\n- [Lightning node information](https://1ml.com/node/025469b50de125b4cd97457c0da67365519f0cd0f441c2ced0978fb6ae7802ae76)\n- [Interesting things to do](https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/spelunking-ln.html)\n",

      "\n\nA safe haven asset is something to buy during economic uncertainty.\nHistorically, the safest asset you can buy has been gold. This is not because\nof anything inherently special about gold, but because that is what people\nbelieve to be the best long term method of storing value.\n\nPeople believe gold is special because they assume that in future other people\nwill believe it's special.\n\n### Criteria for a safe haven asset\n\nA safe-haven asset must fulfil the following criteria:\n\n1. Price isn't controlled by any single party, including a state or bank. The market is spread out beyond the reach of any one organisation. This is important because an asset which is issued, controlled or backed by an organisation has its value tied to the health of that organisation.\n2. Supply isn't controlled by any single party, including a state, bank or anyone else - it exists naturally and the rate at which it's produced or traded is beyond the control of any one organisation.\n3. Supply is limited. The effort required to create the asset naturally limits the supply.\n4. The asset doesn't wear out or expire.\n5. It's prohibitively expensive to fake.\n6. Almost everyone considers it to be precious and valuable.\n7. It can be stored and transported simply. It's not delicate or volatile.\n\nFor these reasons, and because of historical consensus, people have been happy\nto use gold as a store of value in times of economic uncertainty or for long\ndurations. Other assets also meets these requirements to lesser extents.\n\n### Bitcoin compared to gold\n\nConsider why gold is so good as a safe haven asset and long term value store.\nFor all the reasons above, bitcoin is better, except one: At present, not many\npeople consider it to be precious and valuable, so the market is small. This\nwill change as confidence and awareness increases, and the eco-system of\nservices and applications matures.\n\nThe fundamentals are already established:\n\n1. A decentralised network ensures that Bitcoin can't be regulated or manipulated by any single government or organisation. The Bitcoin network can't be turned off.\n2. The present and future rate of supply is publicly available and unchangeable. This increases market efficiency and creates more rational pricing than a market where the rate of supply is unverifiable.\n3. Supply is naturally (mathematically) limited using proof of work algorithms.\n4. Bitcoin doesn't corrode or wear out.\n5. Bitcoin is impossible to fake.\n6. Bitcoin can be stored and transported more easily than gold. - If you can remember 24 words then you can access your bitcoin for free from any internet connection.\n\n### Read more\n\nThis\n[article](http://www.runtogold.com/the-great-bitcoin-bull-market-of-2017/),\npublished a week after I wrote this post, looks at different factors to\nconsider when evaluating Bitcoin's value. It goes into a lot of detail,\nrelative to what I've seen in other articles.\n",

I'm excited about this because I get to work on a really ambitious project using new technology to do something innovative and valuable.\n\n### Bitnation\n\nBitnation's purpose is to offer the same services as governments do, in a way that delivers more benefit to users.\n\nIn the West this may not immediately sound like a big deal. Our governments are fairly organised and the services are usually \"good enough\". Most significantly, we are not used to thinking about ID services (passports, visa, drivers licences) or registration services (land registry, marriage certificates) as a service that we are customers of - like our internet service provider, or our electricity supplier.\n\nIn many parts of the world dysfunctional or unjust governments represent a huge obstacle to improving everyday life, the progress and achievement that many people can hope to realise is limited because of this.\n\nIf there was a viable alternative to a passport from a jurisdiction renowned for forgery, or a credit rating that acknowledged your land holdings despited your governments inability to maintain a credible database, then you could begin to travel, trade and enjoy the benefits that citizens of many western states take for granted.\n\nI'm excited that I get to use my skills in an innovative tech company that is aiming to do something really positive.\n\nServices include secure ID systems, asset registry and dispute resolution. Identification (in particular) is an area full of problems, and blockchain tech could offer some really significant improvements. Bitnation wants to create a platform where voluntary nations can be created and administered, and where people can choose what jurisdictional system they are part of. If this is widely implemented it will be unprecedented.\n\nJurisdictions would offer their own services according to their own principles, and because they are easy to create and membership is voluntarily, jurisdictions would compete to attract citizens. This should lead to improvements for the users of each service, and is intended to provide an alternative to the slow, expensive and opaque processing methods commonly associated with services from geographically defined nationstates.\n",

I haven't included references to Bitcoin or any particular digital currencies or blockchain implementations. This is because a digital currency is just one application of blockchain technology.\n\n## Create a financial document that cannot be forged or disputed\n\nLet's imagine there is a village somewhere where people still trade by bartering. John has some apples whilst Lizzie has some oranges. John would like an orange, and offers Lizzie an apple in exchange. She accepts, and writes John a receipt.\n\n```objdump\ndate: '1234'\nFrom: Lizzie\nTo: John\nWhat: 1 Orange\nPrice: 1 Apple\n```\n\nSo far, so good. The receipt is evidence of the transaction. The next day John wants an orange but doesn't have anything to exchange. He offers to write Lizzie a note saying he owes Lizzie 1 orange (an [IOU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU)). They think about this and agree that John should sign the note so that Lizzie can prove that John owes her 1 orange.\n\n```objdump\ndate: '1234'\nFrom: John\nTo: Lizzie\nWhat: 1 Orange\nSigned: John's signature, Lizzie's signature\n```\n\nThis IOU is a nice gesture, but it's simple to forge. Lizzie has the only copy of the IOU and once Lizzie has seen Johns signature, she could easily copy it and create more IOU's. She could also change this IOU from 1 orange to 11 oranges (for example) and John couldn't prove what the original amount was. If Lizzie and John disagreed over what was owed it would be impossible to know who was telling the truth. It's one person's word against the other.\n\nLizzie realises this and suggests an improvement - they will find a witness and make 3 copies of the IOU. Each copy will be signed by Lizzie, John and the Witness. Lets call this witness \"Walter\".\n\n```objdump\ndate: '1234'\nFrom: John\nTo: Lizzie\nWhat: 1 Orange\nWitness: Walter\nSigned: \"John's signature\", \"Lizzie's signature\", \"Walter's signature\"\n```\n\nThis is a much stronger document and is more difficult to forge. If Lizzie changes the \"What:\" to \"11 Oranges\", both John and Walter will have copies of the original with her signature on it. It will be 2 pieces of evidence against Lizzie's 1. Lizzie will be laughed out of court. Hahaha.\n\n3 Party transactions work pretty well, and this is how most transactions are recorded today. But there is a weakness: If Lizzie can bribe Walter then the transaction can be falsified! John would rely on Walter to verify his version of the transaction but would be let down by Walters lack of integrity. Lizzie and Walter could change 1 orange to 11 oranges and if Lizzie offered Walter some of the extra oranges this would give them both an incentive to forge the documentation. If Walter liked oranges enough, he might not care that his career as a witness will be ruined.\n\nThis is a problem for modern financial systems and a great deal of time, money and regulation is devoted to trying to ensure that third parties are trustworthy. E.G. If I buy a car and my bank is in cahoots with the car dealership, I could be defrauded. Reducing this risk to an acceptably low level makes financial services slower and more expensive than they would otherwise need to be.\n\nThe solution is [public-key infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) (which is introduced in my [previous post](encryption)). In this system, each individual generates their own public-private key pair. They keep their private key private and make their public key freely available. A detailed description of public-key cryptography is out of scope for this post, but briefly:\n\nA public key is derived from a private key, and this pair together have a set of unique mathematical properties. Either key can be used to encrypt a message but only the other key can be used to decrypt it. You cannot use the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. If the private key is used to encrypt then anybody can decrypt (because the public key is publicly available) and whilst this is clearly a terrible way to keep a secret it's a great way to verify who encrypted the message, because only one person has the private key. Because of this, using a private key to encrypt a message is effectively creating a digital signature which cannot be forged. (If the public key is used to encrypt a message then only the private key can be used to decrypt it, and this approach is used to transfer secret data securely).\n\nBack to the fruit. If Lizzie wants to accept John's IOU she can use public-key cryptography and no-one needs to worry about Walter. There are 3 steps to the transaction.\n\n1] Create the IOU stating that John owes Lizzie 1 orange.\n\n```objdump\ndate: '1234 From: John To: Lizzie What: 1 Orange'\n```\n\n2] John creates a public private key pair and encrypts the IOU using his private key. He adds an unencrypted \"From\" line.\n\n```objdump\nFrom: John\ndate: '1234 To: Lizzie, What: 1 Orange <- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key'\n```\n\n3] John makes his public key freely available to anyone who wants it.\n\nThis will work because anybody (not just Lizzie) can check that John signed the IOU. The transaction can be verified by looking at the \"From\" part of that transaction, noticing that this transaction is supposedly from John and then using John's public key to decrypt the encoded \"signature\" line.\n\nThe signature can only be decrypted using John's public key if his private key was used to encrypt it. Because John is the only person with his private key, that proves the transaction is valid, and Lizzie isn't dishonestly creating a debt for John to pay.\n\nClearly if John discloses his private key (or its stolen) then he will make the system insecure, but this is a problem with John and his security protocols, not with public-key cryptography.\n\n## Create and maintain an accurate list of transactions\n\nSo far we've seen how 1 IOU (for an orange) can be securely created, signed and verified. This process can extended to be used by more people to exchange more fruit. For example.\n\nThe original note:\n\n```objdump\nFrom: John\ndate: '1234, To: Lizzie, What: 1 Orange <- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key'\n```\n\nThen some additional transactions:\n\n```objdump\nFrom: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: 2 Apples <- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key\nFrom: John // Date: 1236, To: Chris, What: 1 Banana <- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key\nFrom: Chris // Date: 1237, To: Lizzie, What: 2 Bananas <- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key\n```\n\nAfter these 4 transactions, between John, Chris and Lizzie:\n\n- John owes 1 orange to Lizzie and 1 banana to Chris\n- Lizzie owes 2 apples to John\n- Chris owes 2 bananas to Lizzie.\n\nThis is confusing, (and ridiculous). It is not possible to know who is the most in debt or who is the most wealthy. Lizzie owes 2 apples, but is owed 2 bananas and 1 apple. Does that mean her fruit business is losing money or making money? We cannot say. To be able to know we need to use the same unit of value for all the fruits. Lets say that an orange is worth 2 apples, and a banana is also worth 2 apples (therefore 1 banana = 1 orange.), also lets invent a currency called \"coins\" and say 1 apple is worth 1 coin. The 4 transactions can now be rewritten as:\n\n```objdump\nFrom: John // Date: 1234, To: Lizzie, What: 2 coins <- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key\nFrom: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: 2 coins <- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key\nFrom: John // Date: 1236, To: Chris, What: 2 coins <- Signed and encrypted by John using his private key\nFrom: Chris // Date: 1237, To: Lizzie, What: 4 coins <- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key\n```\n\nBy going through the list of transactions we can see that:\n\n- John owes Lizzie and Chris 2 coins each, and is owed 2 coins from Lizzie. His net amount is -2\n- Lizzie owes John 2 coins but is owed 4 coins from Chris. Her net amount is +2\n- Chris owes Lizzie 4 coins but is owed 2 coins from John. His net amount is -2\n\nSo far Lizzie is the only person who appears to have any business skills.\n\nWhat if Lizzie wanted to use the 4 coins that she is owed by Chris to buy something from John? Could she use this system to transfer Chris' promise to pay her 4 coins so that Chris would pay John instead? The fact that everyone can be sure that the record of the transactions is accurate and authentic allows a debt to be used as payment. Lizzie's transaction would look like this:\n\n```objdump\nFrom: Lizzie // Date: 1235, To: John, What: ba781... <- Signed and encrypted by Lizzie using her private key\n```\n\nThe \"What\" section contains a [hash](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html) of the original transaction (with Chris) that she wants to transfer to John. A hash is the signature for a file or some text and in this case it is the signature for Lizzie's transaction with Chris. The signature is unique to each transaction and identifies which transaction is being used as payment. Because both transactions are signed using Lizzie's private key, it is simple to verify that Lizzie has the right to use this previous transaction where she is owed (or paid) some coins as payment to another person.\n\nThis shows how public-private key infrastructure can be used to securely record transactions and enable trade between a group of people, - under certain conditions. Blockchains can be used to transfer units of value like in this example, but we could just as easily put selfies or certificates of ownership (for houses, financial instruments, diamonds, etc) inside the \"What\" part of the transaction. If we make two other changes - removing the \"To\" part of the transaction, and including a hash of the transaction as part of the text which is signed using a private key. If we do this, then a record would be:\n\n```objdump\nFrom: Chris // Date: 2345, What: \"A photo of me\" <- Signed and encrypted by Chris using his private key\n```\n\nThis would create a reliable record of what Chris claims he looks like. He can confidently send anyone this record and if they have his public key then they can verify that it is Chris himself who signed it and is asserting that the photo is him. If somebody changed the photo then the data in the transaction would change and the transaction will have a new hash value. The new hash value will not match the hash value contained within the signature, and the text in the signature cannot be changed because it can only be encrypted using Chris' private key, which only Chris has. Therefore it will be simple to show that someone other than Chris is trying to change the photo.\n\nAnother use for public-key cryptography arises if Chris were an employee in a bank, and the \"What\" contained documents about a customer the bank is providing financial services for. In this scenario, Chris (representing the bank) is effectively confirming the customer's true identity and documenting the evidence that's been collected to show that the bank knows who their customer really is. If the transaction included a new section called \"Customer ID\" (for example) then a database of all customers whose identity checks have been successfully completed can be made. This can be shared with other departments (or banks) easily and immutably. This is the concept behind KYC on a blockchain.\n\nBack to our fruit traders: At the moment a participant is allowed to carry a net negative balance. For this system to work in reality, the creation of \"coins\" will need to be controlled in order to maintain their value. In the example above, people can freely create \"coins\" and can also carry negative amounts of \"coins\". This would result in the value of a \"coin\" plummeting. Therefore their creation (and conversion from fruit) must be controlled in a predictable manner.\n\nOur examples so far only include 3 people. If there are a lot of people in the network it wouldn't be feasible to insist that everyone is present or online each time a new transaction is added to the list (the chain) of transactions. However if we allow transactions to be added whilst some people are offline we create an opportunity for fraud. The reasons why, and the solution to this and other problems will be described in [part 2](blockchain-networks).\n",

      "\n\n## Maintain an accurate list of transactions across a large group of users, without a central authority\n\nThis is part 2 of an introduction to the key features of a generalised blockchain. [Part 1](blockchain-introduction) introduced key features of immutable record creation between 2 parties using public key cryptography. Part 2 explores how a network of users can maintain the same (true) list of transactions and protect each other against fraud.\n\n## Broadcasting transactions to the network\n\nIn [Part 1](blockchain-introduction) we saw Lizzie, John and Chris exchanging coins. Lizzie also paid John with coins that were owed to her by Chris. These transactions were authenticated using PKI which:\n\n- Ensured transaction integrity\n\n- Prevented participants claiming that they didn't make a past transaction\n- Prevents anyone creating a transaction on someone else's behalf without their consent.\n\nAs the number of people in the network grows, the transfer of coins from one user to another becomes harder to track. If every users ledger is not identical then the opportunity arises to use coins that have already been spent to pay someone who doesn't know they've already been used.\n\nThis is double spending, and is possible because the ledger that is shared amongst all members of the group only has _weak consistency_ - it is not necessarily correct all the time in all locations.\n\n### Weak Consistency\n\nWeak consistency could be solved by requiring that everyone votes to accept a transaction before it is accepted into the ledger (Unanimous consensus), or to save time we could reduce the requirements so that only 50% of all users validate a transaction before it is accepted into the ledger (Quorum consensus). Either of these solutions is possible for a small local group with a list of all users.\n\nHowever Unanimous or Quorum Consensus doesn't solve the weak consistency problem if:\n\n1. The group is large\n2. The group is small but spread across different locations or timezones\n3. It is not possible to know how many members there are and therefore what proportion of users are participating.\n4. The _real_ identity of a user is unknown\n\nIn these cases a peer-to-peer network is required where transactions between users require approval by other users before being confirmed. This has not been trivial to solve, as some users would be incentivised to be dishonest, and some may make mistakes. This is the distributed consensus problem, which on [wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)>) is defined as:\n\n> The consensus problem requires agreement among a number of agents for a single data value. Some of the processes (agents) may fail or be unreliable in other ways, so consensus protocols must be fault tolerant or resilient. The processes must somehow put forth their candidate values, communicate with one another, and agree on a single consensus value.\n\n## Distributed Consensus\n\nWhen the number and identity of participants is known, distributed consensus is possible. Two types of protocol which allows all users in a distributed system to agree on a transaction are the [Paxos](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)>) family of protocols and the [Two-phase commit](http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs5204/fall00/distributedDBMS/duckett/tpcp.html) protocol. Both of these would require that at least 50% of all users reach agreement in order to add a new transaction.\n\nHowever in a public peer-to-peer network the total number of active users is not known - its fast and cheap to create new user profiles, and existing user profiles may become dormant. This makes it impossible to know how many users 50% would be. Additionally, because its possible to cheaply create new user profiles (just generate a new public-private key pair), a single actor could generate and control many user accounts in order to have many votes and force incorrect transactions onto the ledger. An attack where one user subverts a network by creating many profiles is known as a [Sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack).\n\n### Proof of Work\n\nThe solution to the Sybil attack is to increase the cost of verifying a transaction such that the cost exceeds the reward. This is achieved through proof-of-work (PoW) algorithms, which are computationally expensive for a sender claiming to have verified a transaction, and computationally simple for the receiver to verify that the sender has validated the transaction.\n\nOne possible Proof of Work approach is to require that the hash of a verification message begins with a certain set of characters. The chosen set of characters is called a _nonce_ and the only way to create a verification message with an acceptable hash is to try many slightly different messages. For example, a nonce may be 3 zeros. It's arbitrary, but the longer the nonce is the more difficult it becomes to find a hash that fits the requirements.\n\nThis is because a hash is a random list of characters, and altering even a single part of the data being hashed will result in a completely different hash value. Therefore there is no way to predict a hash value. The only way to generate a hash with the required none is to repeatedly alter the data being hashed (even by just one character) until a hash with the required features is randomly achieved. This is computationally expensive to achieve, but computationally simple to verify.\n\nUsing the method, a user who seeks to verify a transaction and broadcast the result must (once they've verified the transactions) repeatedly try different messages until they randomly find a message that meets the nonce requirements. It is simple for a user to check if a transaction verification message meets the nonce requirements, because it is simple to inspect a hash and compare it to the nonce.\n\nThe effect of this requirement is a process that makes it expensive to claim that a transaction has been verified and cheap to check that verification claim. This removes the threat of a Sybil attack, but does not remove the distributed consensus problems created by not knowing:\n\n1. The true identity of users in the network\n2. How many users exist\n\nThis problem cannot be completely solved, and the practical solution is to relax the requirements such that the probability of accepting a fraudulent transaction is lower than some user defined threshold. This is acceptable because a user would require a higher degree of confirmation for a high-value transaction than they would for a low-value transaction, and would therefore be willing to incur more time and cost to verify a high value transaction and reduce the probability of accepting an incorrect transaction below a threshold.\n\nIf a user wishes to make fast or low-value transactions, or trusts the party they're transacting with, then they may accept a transaction without any other users on the network verifying that the sender has the required funds available.\n\nHowever when the senders trustworthiness is not assured, verification is required. The more risky or valuable the transaction, the more users the receiver of the funds will ask to verify that the sender has access to the required funds. The higher the number of users, the higher the probability that a dishonest transaction will be identified before being accepted.\n\nAn appropriate level of verification will depend on the amount being transferred and how well the receiver of the funds knows the sender.\n\n## Transaction fees\n\nAsking peers on the network to verify transactions introduces a new problem. Verifying a transaction requires time and effort, and incurs a cost. This cost requires that network participants be rewarded for correctly verifying transactions between other participants.\n\nAn attacker would only attack if the cost is less than the reward. Therefore the number and cost of verifications required should be just enough to make the cost of an attack more than the value of the transaction.\n\nThis introduces the problem that it costs more to verify a transaction than the value of the transaction itself. It is also create the recursive problem where the users who verified the first transaction would need to verify that the payment they received was then also valid. Furthermore, a high proportion of the original transaction value is spent as a transaction fee (for verification) which is not efficient.\n\nThese problems are avoided by combining multiple transactions and verifying them at the same time, broadcasting the successful verification of multiple transactions simultaneously by grouping the transactions together into a block of transactions.\n\nBy confirming multiple transactions at once (and proving it using proof-of-work), transaction fees can be aggregated (allowing each individual fee to be much lower). Each block includes a list of verified transactions, a reference to the previous block, and a block ID.\n\n## Incentivised social responsibility\n\nThe transaction verification process outlined above is remarkable because it creates a demand for new participants to the network by creating a financial incentive to verify transactions. This makes the network more secure as increasing the number of participants makes a sybil attack more difficult.\n\n## Summary\n\n1. Users generate new transactions and broadcast them on a peer-to-peer network for verification\n\n2. An idle user listens for new transactions and collects them until the sum of all transactions' verification fees is greater than the cost the user will incur to verify them and meet the proof-of-work requirements\n\n3. The idle user adds an extra transaction to their list of transactions that transfers the sum of the transaction fees to their own address.\n\n4. The idle user generates the block of newly verified transactions, referencing the previously verified block so that transactions can be chronologically ordered and completing the proof-of-work challenge. This new block is then broadcast to the network.\n\n5. Other users are listening for new block announcements. These users verify that the block is valid according to the proof-of-work requirements and the order of the blocks.\n\n6. Users with unverified transactions look inside the verified block to see if their pending transactions have been accepted.\n\n## Competing to validate blocks of transactions\n\nEach user can choose which transactions they verify, and how many to verify before beginning the proof-of-work requirement and hopefully collecting the transaction fees. This lack of order around transaction verification is fine because the only way to increase the probability of being the first to claim the transaction fees associated with a collection of transactions (a block) is to spend more CPU power searching for the required partial hash collision.\n\nIf two users complete a block at approximately the same time then the blockchain will look different in different parts of the network, as each completed block begins to propagate and other users accept the new block and add it to their ledger. This is ok if a rule is enforced that requires a user to always accept the longest chain of blocks.\n\nThis works because if multiple blocks are created at the same time, the time it takes to create subsequent blocks will vary due to the random behaviour of the proof-of-work algorithm. Therefore chains of different length will always exist and one version of the block chain will be longer than the others, providing a clear candidate for which branch of the blockchain to use. If there are transactions in the discarded branch which are not present in the new (longest) blockchain then they are added back into the pool of transactions awaiting verification.\n\n## A block of transactions in never absolutely immutable\n\nThe above procedure for verifying transactions and adding new blocks onto the chain means that even if a user inspects a new block and sees that their transaction has been verified, its possible that in the future a longer chain will be discovered (which must be accepted) which doesn't include their transaction.\n\nTherefore any block could potentially be removed, which means a transaction is never completely verified. However the probability of a block being removed decreases as the number of blocks after it increases. This means verification can be thought of in terms of the number of blocks that have been added to the chain _after_ the block containing the transaction.\n\nIf you are willing to accept a high level of risk, or you trust the party you are transacting with you could opt for a small number of blocks to be added after the block containing your transaction. This has the benefit of increasing the speed of the transaction verification. If the transaction is risky or high-value, you might require a larger number of blocks to be added to the chain before accepting the transaction. This will increase the time required to verify the transaction, but reduce the probability that a longer chain will undo the block containing the transaction in question.\n",

      '\n\n"Building a story brand" by Donald Miller is one of the most helpful marketing\nbooks I\'ve found. It explains why things should be done, as well as how to do\nthem.\n\nAs an engineer I love solutions to problems that start from first principles,\nand this feels like that. It\'s strategy as well as tactics.\n\nThese are my notes on an outstanding book.\n\nContents:\n<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />\n\n# Premise\n\n1. People want to <mark>survive and thrive</mark>. They are the main character\n   in the movie of their own life and they have problems. Life is busy and hard\n   and complicated and they don\'t want to waste energy figuring out if you can\n   help them.\n2. Good marketing shows that the product has an <mark>obvious benefit</mark> for\n   the customer. How does your product improve someones ability to "survive and\n   thrive"?\n3. Cut through noisy and challenging world by having a super <mark>quick and\n   easy to understand message</mark>. Don\'t be clever, be clear. Don\'t make the\n   customer spend calories trying to figure out how they will benefit from your\n   product.\n4. Stories are intuitive and leverage many psychological features. They organise\n   information in an intuitive way and are a great way to combat noise and gain\n   attention. <mark>People are compelled to pay attention until all the "story gaps"\n   have been closed</mark>.\n\nCould a caveman look at your website and answer these questions:\n\n1. What do you **offer**?\n2. How will it **improve** my life?\n3. What are the **next steps**?\n\n### Story Gaps\n\n- A gap between a character and what they want. Will they find their way to success, overcome their challenges, etc.\n- Cadence and momentum are defined by the creation and fulfillment of story gaps.\n- If you fail to define something that the customer wants, you fail to open a story gap.\n- This makes the story uninteresting because there isn\'t a question that requires an answer.\n\nStory gaps work because we want things to resolve. It\'s like singing Twinkle\nTwinkle Little Star but stopping before the "are" on the last line. You need to\nhear the last note of the melody for the tune to feel complete.\n\nPare down the customers desire to a single focus. Make your brand known for\nsingle specific desire and helping people get it.\n\nDon\'t clutter the story by diluting the hero\'s desire with other desires. You\ncan eventually develop subplots.\n\n### Apple\n\nWhen Apple released the Lisa computer in 1983, Jobs bought a 9 page ad in the\nNew York times listing the computers features. When Jobs returned to Apple\nafter being fired, (and after partly founding Pixar, which tells stories) Apple\nbecame a customer centric company, and their marketing was about the customers.\n9 pages became 2 words - "Think Different". A message about their customers, and\ntheir customers need to survive and thrive.\n\nApple isn\'t the hero in the "Think Different" brand, the customer is. It\'s the\nsame with Nike - the athletes are the heros, and you can become a (hero) athlete\nwith Nike\'s help. Apple plays a role more like Q in James Bond, giving the hero\nwhat they need to win.\n\n# Stories\n\nA **Hero** → has a **Problem** → and meets a **Guide** → who gives them a **Plan** → and calls them to **Action** → that ends in **Success** → and helps them avoid **Failure**.\n\n![story stages](/static/images/building-a-story-brand/7storystages.png)\n\n# Hero\n\nThe customer, not you. You are the guide. The customer is the main character in\ntheir life and is battling internal and external adversity it order to survive\nand thrive. Heroes have weaknesses, the guide is usually the strongest\ncharacter.\n\nA story <mark>starts with a character who wants to overcome _external_ challenges</mark> that\npose _internal_ and _philosophical_ problems.\n\nYour first task is to create a story gap that implicitly asks "Will the hero get\nwhat they need?"\n\nYou need to define the character\'s ambition at the beginning, so that the\naudience knows what\'s at stake and what kind of a story it is. This messaging\nimplicitly tells them how they could benefit and why they should spend attention.\n\n# Problem\n\nCustomers are more motivated to solve internal problems than external.\n\nIf you <mark>identify a customer\'s problem then you show that you understand</mark> them. This\nis a great hook because they will then relate to your narrative.\n\n<mark>The more we talk about the problems our customers are experiencing, the more\ninterest they will have in our brand.</mark>\n\nEvery story needs a villain, which is the personified problem. The germs are\npersonified, envy is personified, etc. The diminished social status is\npersonified by someone with more status being villainized.\n\nThe **villain**\n\n- should be **relatable** - readers should recognize that the villain should be disdained.\n- should be a **root source** - frustration is what the villain makes us feel. High taxes are the cause, and are therefore the villain.\n- should be **singular** - just one villain, keep it simple to cut through the noise.\n- should be **real** - don\'t be a fear monger. Fight a real problem on behalf of your customers.\n\nThere are three types of **problem**\n\n1. **External** - A barrier to stability that must be removed - My business isn\'t growing fast enough, profits are too small.\n2. **Internal** - I have self-doubt. Do I have what it takes to succeed?\n3. **Philosophical** - I deserve to be successful, my hard work should be rewarded. Failure would be unjust.\n\n<mark> The **villain** initiates an **external** problem that causes the\n**hero** to encounter an **internal** problem that is **philosophically wrong**\nor unjust. </mark>\n\nThe purpose of the external problem is to manifest the internal problem.\nCustomers should recognise and relate to both types of problem.\n\nPut your product in the context of a type of survival they they want. Otherwise\nthere isn\'t a story gap. Translate the **external problem** into several\nsurvival categories:\n\n1. **Resources** - Conserving or accumulating money or time\n1. **Social** - Gaining status or a social network\n1. **Generosity** - Most people are not as Darwinian as we\'ve been led to believe, they want to be empathetic and caring\n1. **Purpose** - Give customers an opportunity to be generous and participate in something greater than themselves - "the chief desire of man is not pleasure, but meaning".\n\n<mark>The only reason that customers buy is because the external problem that your product would solve\nis causing an **internal frustration**</mark>.\n\nIf you <mark>identify and articulate that frustration</mark>, and then <mark>clearly, confidently and\nrepeatedly offer to solve it along with the original external problem</mark> then you bond with\nyour customer. You\'ll have positioned yourself more deeply into their internal\nnarrative and substantially differentiated your brand.\n\n**Philosophical problems** are important because people want to be involved in\nsomething larger than themselves. It adds depth and meaning. Representing (and\nsolving) a philosophical problem gives customers a way of expressing themselves\nthat they wouldn\'t otherwise have.\n\nIf you can **resolve all three problems in the same transaction**, then\ncustomers will experiences a wave of relief and pleasure, and love your brand.\n\nWhen Anakin Skywalker blows up the Deathstar by aiming the perfect shot, he\ndefeats the external problem (the enemy army), his internal problem (self doubt)\nand the philosophical problem (injustice).\n\n<mark> **Your CTA is the action that must be taken to close the final story\ngap** </mark>\n\nChecklist:\n\n1. Is there a **single villain** that your brand stands against?\n2. What **external problem** is that villain causing?\n3. The internal problem is probably found by considering how the external problem makes your customer feel?\n4. What is unjust or wrong about the suffering caused by that villain?\n\n<mark> Our hero is being challenged - will they be able to solve their problem?\nThe only way to find out is to engage with the brand. </mark>\n\n# Guide\n\nCustomers aren\'t looking for another hero, they are the hero in their life. They\nare the main character which the movie of their life revolves around. They\'re\nlooking for a guide because they need help.\n\nA persons life is made up of many acts - "doorways of no return". Each life is\nunique but we all have commonalities. We are all on transformational journeys\nwith common elements.\n\nStory chapters are book-ended by events. These events are always instigated by external\nactors or events beyond their control.\n\nHeroes need a guide who is **trustworthy** and earns **respect**. If they didn\'t\nneed a guide their wouldn\'t be narrative, or a problem. Everyone is looking for a guide to help\nthem solve their problems.\n\n<mark>_We wake up each morning self-identifying as a hero.\nWe are troubled by internal, external and philosophical issues. We know\nthat we can\'t solve our issues on our own._</mark>\n\nThis insight has consequences and raises questions, it means our story isn\'t\nabout us but about others. We can aspire to be someone else\'s guide, but not\ntheir hero. It shows why the search for meaning is innate, but can only be\nresolved by becoming a servant or guide.\n\n_Stop losing sleep over the success of your company and start losing sleep over\nthe success of your customers._\n\nIn stories, heroes are not the strongest characters, they have self-doubt and are\noften ill-equipped. They are often reluctant, and are thrown into the story by\nexternal events. They are "chosen by destiny."\n\nIn contrast, the guide has already "been there and done that." They have already\nconquered the hero\'s internal and philosophical challenges in their own\nbackstory.\n\nThe guide is the one with authority which the authority instinctively recognises\nand accepts. The guide has much more authority than the hero but the main\ncharacter is still the hero.\n\n_Those who realize that the epic story of life is not about them end up winning\nin the end. This is paradoxical. Those who think they are a hero and win usually\nend up being remembered as a villain._\n\n### Characteristics of a guide\n\nEmpathy and Authority are a precise one-two punch.\n\n#### 1. Empathy → Understanding → Trust\n\nWhen we empathise with customers we show that we understand them, and\nunderstanding produces trust.\n\nPeople want to be _seen, heard and understood_. This is the essence of empathy.\n\nKey phrases in your marketing copy could be:\n\n_we understand how it feels to ..._  \n_no-one should have to experience ..._  \n_like you, we are frustrated by ..._\n\nExpressing empathy isn\'t difficult. Once you\'ve identified your customers\ninternal problem, let them know that you understand and would like to help them\nfind a resolution.\n\nBrains like to conserve calories, energy, effort, time, so when a customer\nrealises they have a lot in common with a brand, they fill in any gaps with\ntrust. A customer will "batch" their thoughts, which means they are thinking in\nchunks rather than in details. Commonality, whether in music taste or values, is\na powerful marketing tool.\n\n#### 2. Authority\n\n<mark> No one likes a know-it-all and no one wants to be preached at... But\npeople _do_ want you to establish **competence**. </mark>\n\nWhen looking for a guide, a hero trusts someone who has _demonstrable\ncompetence_. The guide should have some serious experience helping other heroes\nwin their day, but doesn\'t need to be perfect.\n\nThere are **four ways to add authority (competence) to your marketing** without\nbeing arrogant:\n\n1. Testimonials\n2. Logos\n3. Statistics\n4. Awards\n\nMeeting a brand is like meeting a person,\n\n1. Can you help them live a **better life**?\n2. Can they **associate their identity** with your brand?\n3. Can I **respect** this brand?\n4. Can I **trust** this brand?\n\n# Recap\n\n1. We started the narrative by identifying something that the hero wants.\n2. Then we created intrigue and tension by defining the hero\'s problem. The audience wants to know if we can help them overcome the problem!\n3. Then we introduced ourselves as the guide and established authority, empathy and trust.\n\nWhat next? Making a purchase always involves a small risk of wasting money. This\nrisky element makes a purchase somewhat similar to starting a relationship.\nThere is a potential downside, the customer might end up feeling foolish and\nregret their decision.\n\nImagine a customer trying to cross a river to get to their purchase. They can\nhear the sound of a waterfall downstream. If they try to cross it by making a\npurchase then there is a chance that something bad could happen. Put stones in the\nriver so they know how to safely walk across, step by step.\n\nThe stones are the plan.\n\n# Plan\n\nIn a movie, the guide gives the hero a plan. The plan tightens the focus of\nthe movie and creates a "path of hope" for the hero that might, possibly, lead\nto the resolution of the hero\'s problems. It creates a story gap and implicitly\ncreates questions that the audience want to be answered.\n\n<mark> A good plan **removes risk** and **explains what to do**. </mark> If we\ndon\'t guide customers, they experience a little bit of confusion and use that\nconfusion as an excuse to not purchase.\n\nEven though the setup or purchase or after-purchase steps are obvious to us,\nthey are not obvious to customers. Give them a plan and they will feel more\nconfident about purchasing.\n\nHeroes trust a guide who has a plan. People are looking for a philosophy then\ncan embody, or a series of steps they can take to solve their problems.\n\nCustomers want to know where you can take them. Unless you can take them\nsomewhere they want to go, why would they listen? The marketing goal is that\nevery potential customer knows where we want to take them. Define a desire for\nyour customer, and your marketing story will have a powerful hook.\n\n_There are two kinds of plan. Both work by earning trust and offering the\ncustomer a clear path to stability._\n\n- Agreement Plan\n- Process Plan\n\n### Process Plan\n\nThe minimal (3 - 6) steps required to buy _or_ get benefit from the\nproduct after purchase, or a mixture of both. E.g.\n\n1. Make an appointment.\n2. Allow us to create a customized plan.\n3. Let\'s execute the plan together.\n\nA process plan removes confusion from the customers journey. When they see the\nplan they think "oh that\'s not difficult, I can do that" and then they purchase.\n\nA post-purchase process plan would alleviate confusion about how the customer\nwould _use_ the product.\n\n### Agreement Plan\n\nAgreement plans are about <mark>alleviating fears</mark>. It\'s a list of agreements you make\nwith the customer that are designed to alleviate their fears of doing business\nwith you.\n\nAn agreement plan can also work to <mark>highlight shared values</mark>.\n\n_Give the agreement plan a good name and it can increase the perceived value of\nyour product. "the easy-installation plan", "your best nights sleep ever", etc._\n\nAgreement plans can work in the background, they don\'t have to be on the landing\npage, though they could be.\n\nMake an agreement plan by creating a list of all the things a customer could be\nfearful about when doing business with you (haggling for price, interacting with\na pushy salesman, buying a defective product) and then create an promise\nthat would nullify that fear.\n\n# A Call To Action\n\nSo far, we\'ve defined a **desire**, identified their **challenges**,\n**empathized** with them, established our **competency** and given them a\n**plan**.\n\n**Heroes only take action when challenged by an external force.** They\ndon\'t take action by themselves, they _must_ be challenged. This is just how humans\nare.\n\nWe are the external force that guides our customers to success.\n\nHeroes need to be challenged by external forces. Calls to action should be\nclear, and should be repeated over and over. Above the fold, in the center of\nthe page. Also in the navbar. And also repeatedly as they scroll down the page.\n\nCustomers are bombarded with adverts and calls-to-action all day every day. They\nare ignoring things and filtering out noise all the time. So don\'t be shy or\nsubtle. Be very clear. Make it very simple. If you have confidence in your\nproduct, make confident calls to action.\n\n### Direct Calls\n\n- Buy Now\n- Schedule an Appointment\n- Order Now\n- Call Today\n- Register Today\n\nRepeat the same (singular, simple) call to action again and again down the page.\n\n### Transitional Calls\n\n- Download our free PDF guide to growing your business\n- Free information - advice, guides, whitepapers, reports\n- Giving something away for free\n- Testimonials\n- Samples\n- Free-trials\n\n<mark>A good transitional CTA does three things:</mark>\n\n1. Changes the customers perception of you - it establishes your expertise and authority.\n2. Creates reciprocity, you offer them something of value before you ask for their money.\n3. Positions you as a guide for the next steps.\n\nUse both types of CTA (direct and transitional) in your messaging. Then\ncustomers will understand (simply and without burning calories) what you want\nthem to do in order to solve their problems.\n\n# What is at stake?\n\nStories live and die by a single question; "What is at stake?" <mark>If nothing is about to be\ngained or lost then nobody cares.</mark> If there is nothing at stake in the story then\nthere is no story, it\'s just not interesting.\n\nIf there is no benefit to buying the product, then why buy it?\n\n<mark>You have to show the customer the cost of _not buying_ the product.</mark>\n\n# Avoid Failure\n\nThe story remains interesting as long as the hero is teetering on the edge between\nsuccess and failure. **A hero in a story only ever has 2 motivations - to escape\npain or experience something good. Life is like that too, our desire to avoid\npain motivates us to make a change.**\n\nThere needs to be meaningful and consequential stakes in the story, otherwise it isn\'t\ninteresting. Each scene needs to move the hero either closer to or further from\ntheir tragic external threat.\n\n<mark>A brand needs to answer the "what if I don\'t buy" question</mark> otherwise the\ncustomer can\'t answer the "so what?" question - the stakes need to be clearly, simply, concisely\ncommunicated. Probably stake, not stakes.\n\nYou can do it humorously or lightly. Don\'t make a big negative scary thing out\nof it - failure is salt to add flavor, not a\nmain marketing ingredient. Compare the fear to the peace and stability that could be\nachieved. If you show the pain "before" and contrast it to peace and stability\n"after" then you\'ve opened and closed a story loop.\n\nBlog titles, email subjects, headlines, can all contain elements of potential\nfailure to convey a sense of urgency. Bring up the negative stakes a bit.\n\nPeople fear losing &#36;100 more than they desire gaining &#36;100 - loss and pain is\nmore motivating than reward and peace.\n\n### Recipe\n\n1. **Let the reader know they are vulnerable to a threat. "X% of Y get W"**\n2. **Let the reader know that since they _are_ vulnerable, they should take action\n   to reduce their vulnerability. "Make sure this doesnt happen and protect\n   yourself"**\n3. **Give the customer a clear, concise simple plan to reduce their\n   vulnerability. "We offer the thing you need"**\n4. **Challenge people to take the next step right now. The CTA. "Call us today to\n   arrange an appointment"**\n\nAgitate a bit of fear, and then return the reader to peace and prosperity, all\nwithin 1 or 2 paragraphs.\n\n<mark>_What are you helping your customers avoid?_</mark>\n\nIt\'s only a little salt to add flavor. If it\'s too little, customers won\'t know\nwhy your product is important. If it\'s too strong it\'ll be off-putting.\n\n# End with Success\n\n<mark>Humans are looking for resolution to their external, internal and philosophical\nproblems. They can achieve this though status, self-realization,\nself-acceptance, and transcendence (among other things).</mark>\n\nIf you product or service can help people achieve this then it should be a\ncentral part of your brand promise.\n\nPeople want to change their lives and be taken into a new reality. Tell them how\ntheir lives are going to improve - peace, status, confidence, abilities,\npreparedness.\n\nPeople want a vision of a happy ending. Compare these two statements: _"We\'re\ngoing to put a man on the moon"_ or _"We would like a highly competitive and\nsuccessful space program"_\n\nUse this table to show how your customer\'s lives will change. It will give lots of good\ncopy for your marketing:\n\n|                            | Before your brand | After your brand |\n| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |\n| What do they have?         |                   |                  |\n| What are they feeling?     |                   |                  |\n| What\'s an average day like |                   |                  |\n| What is their status?      |                   |                  |\n\nTalk about the end vision really clearly. And use images of happy, successful,\npowerful people enjoying the benefits of your product. Say the benefits loudly,\nconfidently, clearly, simply, repeatedly.\n\nTalk about your end-vision for their lives once they\'ve benefited from your\nservice.\n\nShow the customer a vision of how great their life will be if they do business\nwith you.\n\n<mark>Ultimately, the end of the story should be a list of resolutions to your\ncustomers problems. How do they feel and how have philosophical/justice\nquestions been resolved?</mark>\n\nStories usually end in one of three ways:\n\n1. The hero **gains status** or power\n   - Offer access - get a free coffee.\n   - Offer a premium - skip the line.\n   - Create scarcity - write "limited" on it.\n   - Identity association - wear a Rolex and be associated with what Rolex stands for.\n2. The hero **becomes whole** by being unified with someone\n   - The hero needed something they couldn\'t get themselves, and external provision has saved them.\n   - Reduced anxiety, or more security.\n   - Reduces effort, or more convenience.\n   - More time, reaches an aspirational lifestyle.\n3. The hero has some internal realisation (coming of age) that gives them\n   **confidence to overcome** their circumstances or internal shortcomings and become "whole" and wise.\n   They can achieve inner peace and know they reached their potential.\n   - Inspiration - chariots of fire - you can also run really fast\n   - Acceptance - fashion brands doing positive body image\n   - Transcendence - greater purpose and meaning - fair-trade coffee\n\n# People want your brand to participate in their transformation\n\nA hero needs someone else to step into their life, tell them they are different\nand special and better. That someone is a guide, that\'s you.\n\nOffering an aspirational identity to our customers adds a lot of value to our\nproducts and services. Realise that your customers want to transform and improve\nthemselves.\n\n**People are looking for a guide**. Everybody wants to change either into someone\nbetter or someone more self-accepting. You are helping them become wiser,\nfitter, more equipped, accepted or peaceful.\n\n**What does the customer want to become?**\n\n- what is their aspirational identity?\n- what kind of person do they want to be?\n- How do they want their friends to talk about them?\n\nBeing a guide is a position of the heart, not just a marketing tactic. Lose\nsleep over your customers problems instead of your business. Commit to solving\ntheir internal, external and philosophical problems, and give them a vision to\naspire to.\n\nCustomers needs to be told very clearly how much other customers have changed\nand how far journey has taken them. Usually, the hero is deeply flawed right up\nuntil the final climactic scene.\n\nNot all elements of a story should be used evenly.\n\n# Implementation\n\n## Websites\n\n- Above the fold, use the one-liner. It\'s one sentence saying what\'s in it for the customer. What\n  problem do you solve, what aspirational identity do you offer. It will also\n  give customers words they can use to tell others about your business.\n- Big obvious calls to action, in multiple places. Don\'t be timid.\n- Customers read in a Z shape.\n- People don\'t read websites, they scan them. Repeat the important things\n  so that they are understood by quick readers. Use very few words.\n  - The fewer words you use, the more likely they will be read.\n  - Perhaps 10 sentences on the entire landing page\n  - Increase the amount of text towards the bottom. The top needs to be short,\n    fast, positive and obvious.\n  - Use a "read more" button to expand longer text, then customers have the\n    option if they want.\n- Place a transitional call to action next to the main call to action. "Download\n  a guide" next to "buy now". Put the transitional CTA in less bright colors.\n- Repeatedly ask people to buy, twice above the fold and then in subsequent\n  sections. If you don\'t tell people what to do then they won\'t do it.\n- Include images of success - people enjoying the benefits - resolved problems,\n  aspirations achieved, closed story loops. A sense of health, well-being and\n  satisfaction.\n- The flow of the landing page should follow the StoryBrand framework, albeit\n  not exactly.\n\n## Corporations\n\nNot applicable, but if you\'re a manager and you give your team a narrative they\ncan fit themselves into I guess they\'re going to have more purpose, confidence\nand meaning.\n\n# Marketing Road-map\n\n### Five steps, expanded below:\n\n1. Create a _one-liner_. Say how can you make their lives better in an engaging\n   way.\n2. Create a _lead generator_ and get qualified email addresses. A guide, a free 30\n   minute consultation, a voucher, etc.\n3. An automated _email campaign_ - a weekly email, 3 with nurturing advice and\n   then 1 with a CTA. All automated.\n4. Collect and tell stories of _transformation_. Almost all stories are about the\n   transformation of the hero. Tell this story and people will understand what\n   you are offering.\n5. Create a system that generates _referrals_. If word of mouth is so powerful,\n   incentivize it.\n\n## 1. One-liner\n\nThe one-liner is a statement. It could be more than 1 sentence, but its supposed\nto be super short. It\'s the equivalent of a logline for a movie. Keep editing it\nuntil you find a version that works.\n\nMemorize it, put it on your website, and include it in every piece of marketing collateral you\ncreate.\n\n- You could tell this to anybody and they would understand what you do.\n- Helps people realize they need your services.\n- Provoke imagination and intrigue.\n- It should include:\n  - A character ("A busy mom", "A retiree")\n  - A problem - don\'t miss an opportunity to talk about a customers\n    challenges. Define the problem as vitally important, it opens a story\n    gap and customers will want you to close it.\n  - A plan - hint at it. You can\'t explain it all in a one-liner.\n  - Success - paint an image of life after a customer has bought your services.\n\n### Example answers to the question "What do you do?":\n\n"We provide busy moms with a short, meaningful workout they can use to stay\nhealthy and have renewed energy" vs "I run a gym".\n\n"We help retired couples who want to escape the cold avoid the hassle of a\nsecond mortgage while still enjoying the warm beautiful weather of Florida\nduring the winter" vs "I got involved in real estate a few years ago and when we\nhad out second kid we moved to Florida and then...."\n\n## 2. Create a lead generator\n\n- A guide to download.\n- A free webinar or online course.\n- Software demo or free trials.\n- Free samples.\n- Live events.\n\nNo need to reinvent the wheel, what are others doing?\n\nYou can give away quite a lot of value that is easy to consume in an email or\nPDF - people will consume it quickly and will probably be happy to pay for a\nchance to learn in a more thorough and detailed context.\n\nDownloadable guides etc should be about 3 pages in length.\n\nBe generous, explain the "why" and give away as much of the "how" as possible.\n\n## 3. An automated email campaign\n\nEven if customers don\'t click the links in the email, they keep seeing your\nbrand and they become familiar with it. When they need your services you will be\nthe go-to brand in their mind. The relationship and association is already\nbuilt.\n\nNurturing emails and Call-To-Action emails - 3:1 - put real value in the\nnurturing emails.\n\nDon\'t be passive in the CTA emails - you want them to buy, so tell them,\nrepeatedly, and make it easy.\n\n1. Talk about a problem\n2. Describe a product you offer that solves the problem\n3. Describe what life can look once the customer has bought your product and\n   solved their problem\n4. Call the customer to an action that leads directly to a sale.\n\nSimilar to a nurturing email, a direct action email also describes a problem and\na solution, but in the direct email the solution is a product you sell and there\nis a strong call to action. A lot of the content can be taken from the\nStoryBrand script.\n\n## 4. Collect and tell stories of transformation\n\nA great testimonial gives customers the gift of going second, and lowering the\nriskiness of purchasing.\n\nA good testimonial will:\n\n- showcase the value you create\n- the results\n- the experience\n- what transformation has occurred?\n\nFew things are more important to a good story than a hero that experiences an\nexternal and internal and philosophical transformation. This is because everyone\ndesires to be transformed in someway.\n\nPeople love businesses that help them transform in some way.\n\nQuestions to get a good testimonial:\n\n1. What was the problem you were having before you discovered our product?\n2. What did the frustration feel like as you experienced that problem?\n3. What was different about out product?\n4. Take us to the moment when you realized our product was actually working to\n   solve your problem?\n5. Tell us what life looks like now that your problem is solved or being solved?\n\n## 5. Create a system to incentivise referrals\n\n1. Identify your existing ideal customers\n2. Give them a reason to talk about you - create a video or a PDF that a\n   customer can send to their friends to help them introduce your brand and\n   explain the value you deliver.\n3. Offer a reward - a discount, more access, extra samples, etc\n',

    title: "Building my own web analytics",
    tags: ["cloud-functions", "data"],
    category: "Technical/Web,",
    content:
      "\n\nI've built a simple client-side website analytics tool for this site, you can\nsee it at [/analytics]({filename}/pages/website-analytics.md). It has the\nfollowing metrics:\n\n- Page views per day,\n- Unique IP addresses per day\n- Views per page per day.\n\nThis article eventually made it to the front page of [Hacker\nNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27686873), which resulted in a lot of\nextra traffic and an opportunity to see how the tool performed under a much\nheavier load. I wrote about the affects of this and subsequent design changes\n[here](loadtesting-analytics).\n\nI compare the different results from CloudFlare Analytics, CloudFlare Web\nAnalytics and my own tool in this follow-up\n[article](analytics-comparison).\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Google Analytics\n\nGoogle Analytics felt like overkill. It has so many data-points that the\nuseful metrics are obscured. I also like this site to load quickly\nand GA makes it slower.\n\n### CloudFlare Analytics\n\nI've also tried CloudFlare Analytics. It's a lot simpler than GA and better\nsuits my use case, but I don't think its accurate.\n\n## Design Considerations\n\nThe analytics should be easy to access and easy to understand.[ref]In Google\nAnalytics it can be fun clicking around on all the things and seeing lots of\noptions, but its not really useful once the novelty has worn off.[/ref]\n\nI know from my work visualizing data and building dashboards that the metrics\npresented will alter the users perception of the underlying reality.\n\nThe way that someone thinks about their impact on a business, the value they've\nproduced, or the dynamics of the underlying system (a product's quality, site\nperformance, growth, etc) is influenced by the design decisions I make, such as\nwhich metrics are available, how easy they are to access, or which metrics are\nabove the fold.\n\nIf I present a particular metric as if its important, it will be difficult\nfor someone who uses the dashboard to resist this implied message. They'll eventually\nconsider the metric as a Key Indicator of some kind.\n\nFor these reasons I wanted to see only the most important metrics about my\nwebsite, and I wanted to see them in a simple way without distraction.\n\nThe only metrics I'm interested in are:\n\n1.  How many people are reading my site\n1.  What are they reading\n1.  How much are they reading.\n\nI'd like to be able to infer whether I have a few people who read a lot, or a lot of people\nwho read a little. (Or, as is the case, a few people who read a little.)\n\n## Method\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe main reason for making my own analytics tool it because its a fun challenge\nwith an obvious and useful result. Building it required connecting a few technologies -\nServerless Computing (Cloud Functions on GCP), NoSQL databases (DataStore),\nJavaScript, HTTP headers.\n\n### Assumptions\n\nI'm assuming that unique IP addresses is a good enough proxy for unique readers, even\nthough I'm not considering crawlers, bots, or RSS subscribers[ref]I think this\nmight be quite wrong, but I don't know why.[/ref] .\n\n### Technique\n\nThe analytics \"engine\" works by consuming a request that is sent by the client\neach time a page is loaded. The request is parsed by a Cloud Function on GCP\nwhich extracts the page URL and the IP address. This is then recorded in a\nDataStore database along with the current date and time.\n\nViewing the analytics is as simple (and as complicated) as making a request to\nthe database, parsing the data and visualizing it conveniently. For example,\ngroup the data by days and count the distinct IP Addresses to figure out how\nmany people are visiting each day. This is achieved by making a request to\nanother Cloud Function that returns a response with a JSON payload.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution, there are edge cases I'm not considering. I expect\nit to be mostly right and good enough for my purposes. It didn't take much\neffort and it was a fun mini project. The hardest part was figuring out\n`chart.js`, the slowest part was iterating on the Cloud Functions.\n\n### Mocking Cloud Functions\n\nI haven't figured out how to easily test cloud functions locally - it would\nrequire setting up a NoSQL database and mocking Flask requests and responses.\nInstead of doing that, I watched Peaky Blinders for a couple of minutes whilst\neach new version of the Cloud Function was deploying.\n\n### Improvements\n\nEventually I'll want to group the metrics by week or month I expect. It'll be a\ngood way of learning and playing with cloud technologies and JavaScript.\n\nUnless someone decides to spam the site, I expect the costs to be less than\n€1/month. This site is hosted using CloudFlare, so I suppose I could setup some\npage rules to prevent malicious traffic[ref]The page is now rate limited to 5\nrequests per minute per IP address.[/ref] .\n\n## Tasks for later\n\n- [x] Make `/analytics.html` load faster - latency is caused by the Cloud Function initialising. Short of paying actual money for always-on resources I can't see a way to reduce this. However it's only an issue if you are the first person to view the page in the last ~10 minutes - this [blog post](https://mikhail.io/serverless/coldstarts/gcp/) explains whj.\n- [x] Add loading spinners - I used the same snippets as in my [Machine Vision demo](portfolio-traffic-lights).\n- [ ] Group data by weeks or months as well as day.\n- [ ] Identify bots and search engines - the analytics requires JavaScript to be running so I think some types of non-human activity is already filtered. How can I do this?\n- [ ] Aggregate the data (once per day) in a Cloud Function instead of repeatedly in the browser.\n- [ ] Understand why the DataStore API is called multiple times for a single fetch.\n\n## Questions\n\n1.  I'd be interested to know if there is a way to track RSS subscribers. I know\n    that the usual method is to inspect server logs, but this site is hosted on\n    GitHub pages so I don't think this is possible.\n1.  To what extent does requiring JavaScript in order to log a page view filter out bots and crawlers?\n1.  I've used the `chart.js` library because its reasonably fast and lightweight. My\n    preferred library would be `Plotly` if it could be responsive and fast even\n    if there are >10 charts to render.\n\n    Has `plotly.js` improved recently to the point where it wouldn't cause a browser to lag if multiple plots are being rendered?\n\nFinally, it occurs to me that I could make an analytics widget for my desktop\nusing [Übersicht](https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/). It could show page views\nfor the current day perhaps. I've made a couple of widgets before\n[[1](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#time_since),\n[2](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#time_until)] which were written in\nCoffeeScript, but the newer widgets are written in React, so I guess this is an\nopportunity to learn[ref]Done! My desktop now looks like this:\n\n![Dekstop widgets](/static/images/widgets.png)[/ref] .\n\nWriting the \"Time Since\" (my daughters birth) and \"Time Until\" (my next\naccounting exam[ref]I failed the exam because I'd been working on\n[Ry's Git Tutorial](git) instead.[/ref] ) widgets were my\nfirst ever taste of CSS, HTML and JavaScript. The first ever article on\nthis blog was about the \"Time Since\" widget. CoffeeScript, and Ubersicht were\njust about simple enough for me to learn by trial and error, copying someone\nelse's code and changing it bit by bit until I had what I want.\n\n[**Site Analytics**]({filename}/pages/website-analytics.md)\n",

    id: "buying-btc",
    title: "How to buy Bitcoin",
    tags: ["bitcoin"],
    category: "Technical/Cryptocurrencies",
    content:
      "\n\nRecently a few friends have asked me how they can buy Bitcoin. I'm not a financial advisor, but here are a few things that come to mind:\n\n1.  Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.\n\n2.  If the price falls 50%, you need to be able to wait whilst the price\n    recovers.\n\n3.  Write down the following:\n\n    - How much can you afford to invest? Consider how much cash you will need over the next year, how long it would take to recover any losses, etc.\n    - How long do you want to invest for?\n    - How much profit do you want to make? Don't have an open-ended goal.\n\n4.  You will need to get good at identifying and ignoring the following, even from your friends:\n\n    - Hype\n    - Fake news\n    - Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD)\n\n    Don't trust without verifying.\n\n5.  The previous point is really important, and also difficult.\n\n    By putting something you care about in a risky situation (it is risky) you\n    will experience anxiety and excitement. You need to control your psychology\n    and identity when other people are trying to manipulate you. This is useful\n    in all areas of life.\n\n    Investing is\n    good mental exercise because money has an intensely psychological quality\n    about it, and crypto currencies are the most intense trading experience\n    there is right now.\n\n6.  Almost no one has a clue what's happening. Conventional economists and\n    traders certainly don't. This is crypto-economics and the rules haven't been\n    worked out yet. We've never had this tech before, and the internet has made\n    everything - communication and innovation - much quicker. This is a powerful\n    combination of factors and we haven't seen them play out before.\n\n7.  Take some time to read about the fundamentals and understand the tech as\n    much as you can. Think about why people would behave in certain ways and\n    what makes bitcoin useful, or not. Get started on this today, it will take\n    some time.\n\n    - YouTube has a tonne of videos, and these two sites are good and detailed:\n      - [lopp.net](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html)\n      - [namamotoinstitute.org](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/)\n    - Twitter has a lot of current and new information, but also a lot of bots and scammers spreading hype and FUD (see point 4).\n\n8.  If you're going to lose sleep over your investment, invest less.\n\n9.  Don't buy at an all time high. Do your research, wait for the price to\n    correct. _Prices fall._ The\n    [chart](https://uk.tradingview.com/x/TrL9SA7o/) at the top of the page\n    shows the 20 day and 55 day moving average compared to the daily price. My\n    opinion is that by early January the price will have returned to between\n    the 20 day and 55 day average before beginning to rise again.\n\n10. [Coinbase](http://www.coinbase.com) is a user friendly and reputable\n    exchange, there are other good exchanges too.\n\n11. Don't make financial decisions when you're feeling rushed. Check your psychology.\n\n12. If you've bought some Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, don't store them\n    on an exchange. Transfer them to a wallet that you control. If you don't\n    own your private key, you don't own the asset. If you don't know what\n    that means, google it (Point 8).\n",

      "\n\nIf many different customers are to deposit or send ADA (The unit of currency on the\nCardano blockchain) to a Cardano node, it will be necessary to determine which\ncustomer is responsible for each transaction so that the correct customer\naccount can be updated.\n\nAs with many things involving blockchains, this initially seemed like a simple\nrequirement but involved several hours of work.\n\nCardano wallets are generated using a parameter called ADDRESS_POOL_GAP. The\ndefault value is 20, and is the number of unused addresses that the node will\ngenerate and return to a client using the REST API. If one of the addresses is\nused, the node will automatically generate another so that there are always 20\nunused addresses.\n\nThis is probably very convenient for personal use. If I want someone to send me\nsome funds, I can make a simple api call using cURL and get a fresh address.\nBut if you are running a service, weather its e-commerce or a financial\nservice, its not really good enough. Some advice on the forums says to generate\na wallet with a very large ADDRESS_POOL_GAP value such as 10,000 and just\ngenerate a new wallet when you run out of fresh addresses, but it still\nfeels like a compromise.\n\nBut lets explain our situation in more detail first. If a customer wants to\nsend us some ADA, we want to give them a fresh address that's never been used\nbefore and that only they have. Then we know that any funds that arrive to that\naddress are from a particular customer. However we don't know if the customer\nwill actually use the address and transfer any funds. The address might remain\nunused or it might not. Nevertheless, that address is now reserved for them,\nand no one else can use it.\n\nIn this way, we might need to generate and maintain a list of thousands of\naddresses that are never used. Using ADDRESS_POOL_GAP for this seems like a bad\nsolution.\n\nFortunately,\n[Cardano-Addresses](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-addresses) has\nthe answer, albeit in a fairly convoluted and obscured form. If you have the\nmnemonic that was used to generate a wallet originally, you can generate 2^31\nunique addresses like so:\n\nClone the repo and build the docker image:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet\ndocker build -t cardano-address .\n```\n\nGet the mnemonic and generate a file containing a list of space separated words on one row.\n\nRun the following:\n\n```bash\nexport increment=0\n((increment=increment+1)) && cat mnumonic.txt | docker run --rm -i cardano-address key from-recovery-phrase Shelley | docker run --rm -i cardano-address key child 1852H/1815H/0H/0/$increment | docker run --rm -i cardano-address key public --with-chain-code  | docker run --rm -i cardano-address address payment --network-tag testnet > payment.addr && cat payment.addr ;echo\n```\n",

      '\n\nI recently deployed a Cardano node on Google Cloud Platform and used its API to\ncreate and watch addresses, and make transactions.\n\nHelpfully, Cardano make it quite simple to get up and running if you are\nfamiliar with Docker-Compose, and know where to look, and what questions to ask.\n\nContents:\n<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />\n\n# Docker Compose\n\nThe [Cardano Wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet)\nrepo[ref][https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet)[/ref]\ncontains almost all you need to get started. The command to run is:\n\n`NETWORK=testnet docker-compose up -d`\n\nThis does a couple of things for you:\n\n1. Creates a Cardano node and begins syncing with the network\n2. Creates a Cardano Wallet instance\n3. Creates all the required data volumes\n4. Maps the ports required to make API calls.\n\nRunning `docker ps` should show that two containers are running, `cardano-node`\nand `cardano-wallet`.\n\n# Cardano wallet\n\nIn order to run `cardano-wallet` commands (not using the API, but directly on\nthe node) you\'ll need to `docker exec` into the container like this:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker exec -it cardano-wallet_cardano-wallet_1 sh\n```\n\nThen you can run commands like:\n\n```bash\ncardano-wallet network information\n```\n\n# Cardano-CLI\n\nSimilarly, if you want to use the `cardano-cli` programme, exec into the\n`cardano-wallet` container:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker exec -it cardano-wallet_cardano-node_1 sh\n```\n\n```bash\ncardano-cli —version\n```\n\n# REST API\n\nPerhaps you wont need to do this though because once the containers are up and\nrunning and online, you can use the REST API to monitor the node, make\ntransactions, and watch\naddresses.[ref][https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/#operation/postwallet](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/#operation/postWallet)[/ref]\n\nFor example, a good test to see if the node is ok is to run\n\n```sh\ncurl http://localhost:8090/v2/network/information\n```\n\nAddresses on Cardano need to be BIP39 compliant, and before you can use the\nREST API to create the address you will need to have already generated the keys\nand the mnemonic. This can be done using various other tools\n([web page](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/), [python](https://github.com/trezor/python-mnemonic)) and the results put into a JSON file\naccording to the API spec.\n\n# Surprising things\n\nCardano requires that addresses are created sequentially and instead of\nallowing the user to generate them _ad-hoc_, the node by default will manage\nthe creation of addresses of each\nwallet.[ref][https://input-output-hk.github.io/adrestia/docs/common-use-cases/how-to-create-addresses/](https://input-output-hk.github.io/adrestia/docs/common-use-cases/how-to-create-addresses/)[/ref]\n\nThe value of `ADDRESS_POOL_GAP` sets the number of unused addresses in each\nwallet. By default this is 20. When an address is used, the node will\nautomatically generate a new unused address for the wallet, so that there is\nalways a pool of 20 unused addresses.\n',

      '\n\n[Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io) is a dotfiles management tool. I wrote about\nit [previously](chezmoi) when I almost deleted my\ndotfiles and was looking for a better way to manage them.\n\n7 months later and I\'m happy I chose Chezmoi. I\'m managing dotfiles across 3\nmachines and 2 OS\'s currently. I have a basic workflow and it seems like a good\ntime to see if there are further benefits to be found. This is a review of my\nworkflow and some notes on how to use the tool more effectively.\n\nI\'ve aliased `chezmoi` to `cm` in this article and on all my machines.\n\nIncluding files or subdirectories from other projects is really interesting and\nsomething I didn\'t realise was possible. It goes a long way to bridging the gap\nbetween simple dotfiles management and something more powerful like Ansible.\n\nNext steps (in another 7 months?) would be to use [templates](https://www.chezmoi.io/docs/how-to/#use-templates) and make use of\nthe secrets management capabilities.\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  When you `cm init` you create a new git repo in `~/.local/share/chezmoi`.\n    This is where the _source state_ lives. It\'s a repo, so you can do all the\n    usual vcs things you\'d expect, but cm won\'t do it for you (by default).\n\n1.  `cm edit-config` opens the configuration file for editing.\n\n## Include dotfiles from other projects\n\n1.  Use `.chezmoiexternal.toml` to tell cm to import dotfiles from a different\n    repo. See below for an example\n\n1.  You can\'t include subdirectories from other projects like `oh-my-zsh`\n    because you can\'t use git submodules (cm uses its own format for the source\n    state).\n\n1.  The section heading (the part with square brackets) is the destination path\n    of the object being imported.\n\n1.  `type` is "archive" for collections of files (projects) and "file" for\n    individual files. If the url is a tarball then cm will unpack it.\n\n1.  The default value for `refreshPeriod` is never. Cm caches downloaded archives locally to\n    avoid downloading them every time `apply` is called. To force a refresh, call\n    `cm --refresh-externals apply` or `cm -R apply`.\n\n1.  When using `Oh My Zsh`, make sure you disable auto-updates by setting\n    `DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE="true"` in `~/.zshrc`. Auto updates will cause the\n    `~/.oh-my-zsh` directory to drift out of sync with cm\'s source state.\n    Refresh the downloads (by setting `refreshPeriod`) to update Oh My Zsh and\n    its plugins.\n\n## Adding files and directories\n\n1.  You add a file to cm with `cm add &lt;file&gt;`. This copies the file\n    into the source state but changes the name. If the file you want to track is\n    `~/.zshrc` then cm will create a file in the source state called\n    `dot_zshrc`.\n\n1.  You can `cm add <dir>` just like you can `cm add &lt;file&gt;`. If you copy a\n    directory into the source state, the name of the source state copy will be\n    prepended with `dot_`, too. The names of the files and dirs inside the\n    directory are not changed.\n\n## Which files are tracked, not tracked or ignored\n\n1.  `cm managed` shows a list of manged files\n\n1.  `cm unmanaged` shows a list of unmanaged files. You can add entire\n    directories with `cm add`.\n\n1.  `.chezmoiignore` contains a list of files that _won\'t_ be copied from the\n    source directory to the destination when you run `cm apply`. This is the\n    opposite of my intuition [[documentation](https://www.chezmoi.io/docs/reference/#chezmoiignore)].\n\n1.  Because `cm apply` can change so much stuff, try `cm apply --dry-run --verbose` first.\n\n1.  `.chezmoiignore` is a template, so you can ignore different files on\n    different machines.\n\n## Editing tracked files\n\n`cm diff` will show you what changes would be applied if your ran `cm apply`\nfrom the perspective of the source state (Green ⇒ added to source state).\n\n`cm apply` will overwrite local changes (after prompting for confirmation) with\nthe copy from the source state.\n\nYou can resolve differences if things get messy with `cm merge $FILE`.\n\nThere are 4 ways of editing files:\n\n1.  `chezmoi edit $FILE` - opens \\$FILE in the editor. `cm edit` will open the\n    source state directory. You can also use `cm edit --apply $FILE` to apply\n    the changes as soon as you close the file.\n\n1.  `cm cd` and then edit the files directly. Then `cm apply` to apply the\n    changes. `cm diff` will show you what changes would be made by running `cm apply`, from the perspective of the source state. (Green means added to the\n    source state, red is removed. This is the opposite of my intuition).\n\n1.  Edit the file in the home directory and then re-add it using `cm add $FILE`\n    or `cm re-add` (re-add doesn\'t work with templates). I\'ve created an alias\n    to re-add all files that have been changed `cm aa`.\n\n1.  Edit the file in the home directiry and then merge the changes into the\n    source state with `cm merge $FILE`.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Importing an entire project:\n\nTo import `Oh My Zsh`, the `zsh-syntax-highlighting` plugin, and `powerlevel10k` by putting the following in `~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiexternal.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[".oh-my-zsh"]\n    type = "archive"\n    url = "https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/archive/master.tar.gz"\n    exact = true\n    stripComponents = 1\n    refreshPeriod = "168h"\n[".oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting"]\n    type = "archive"\n    url = "https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/archive/master.tar.gz"\n    exact = true\n    stripComponents = 1\n    refreshPeriod = "168h"\n[".oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k"]\n    type = "archive"\n    url = "https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/archive/v1.15.0.tar.gz"\n    exact = true\n    stripComponents = 1\n```\n\n### Importing a single file from another project\n\nTo import `plug.vim` from `github.com/junegunn/vim-plug` into `~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim` add this to\n`~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoiexternals.toml`\n\n```toml\n[".vim/autoload/plug.vim"]\n    type = "file"\n    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim"\n    refreshPeriod = "168h"\n```\n\n## Source\n\nMost of this was taken directly from the [documentation](https://www.chezmoi.io/docs/how-to/).\n',

      "\n\nContents:\n<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude=\"Overview\" toHeading={2} />\n\nUpdate: 7 months later, I've written some more detailed notes\n[here](more-chezmoi).\n\n# Background\n\nChezmoi seems to be dotfiles management for power users. Until a few days ago,\nwhen I realised I'd massively broken a lot of things, I'd been putting my\ndotfiles in a version controlled directory and using a shell script to generate\nsymlinks in my home directory.\n\nThis had worked really well for several years. It's a great system for\nmaintaining dotfiles on a single machine. But it's not robust or flexible enough\nfor managing multiple machines or multiple operating systems.\n\nAlso, it's not just files that sit in _$home_ anymore, I need to track\nconfiguration files that live in other places too[ref]For example, every file\nin `$HOME/.vim/ftplugin/` should be version controlled.[/ref].\n\nI needed something more robust and flexible than generating symlinks from a\nbash script.\n\n# Razor\n\nI think I read somewhere that when purchasing a new appliance you should buy\nthe cheapest you think you can get away with, and if that doesn't work then get\nthe best you can afford. Moving from a custom bash script to Chezmoi is an\nexample of this. My custom bash script was the most basic approach, and it\nbroke badly. Chezmoi seems like the most heavy duty tool for dotfiles management\nI could find.\n\nFor example, I think I'm able to encrypt my files using 1Password or similar.\nI can use Jinja templates to create scripts for different scenarios. I\ndon't even know what that means at the moment. I've only scratched the surface\nbut I'm happily managing dotfiles across different machines and\nupdating/modifying them safely. Chezmoi (aliased to cm) is free and OSS so I'm\nconfident it'll be \"my\" tool for the next few decades. I'm happy to invest a\ncouple of hours to learn a few new habits and iron out a few\nwrinkles[ref]Happily, it seems like the amount of time required to learn or\nbecome familiar with a new tool is decreasing. I guess this is to be expected\nas experience increases but nonetheless it's gratifying to realise.<br></br>Dotfiles\nmanagement was a fairly new and interesting concept when I first began\nsymlinking into my home directory. It still feels amazing to bootstrap a fresh\nmachine and have it feel like home in just a few minutes, but the\ntechnicalities of it are now familiar.[/ref].\n\n# One Question\n\nI don't understand why `chezmoi cd` creates a new shell in order to jump into the\nChezmoi directory. Why not simply `cd` into the Chezmoi directory? What's the\nadvantage/necessity of a new shell?\n\nYou have to remember to `exit` after you've done whatever you went there to do,\nbut my habit is to `cd` or `z ..`. I guess it's nice to exit and then\nimmediately go back to where ever you were before, but there are other ways of\ndoing that - you could write the current directory to an environment variable.\nIt seems unnecessarily complex.\n\n# Command Reference\n\nUpdate - the notes in my [follow-up](more-chezmoi) are likely much more useful.\n\n1.  Show which files have changed → **cm status**\n\n1.  List of managed files → **cm managed**\n\n1.  List of unmanaged files → **cm unmanaged**\n\n1.  Start tracking a file → **cm add &gt;path&#47;to&#47;file&lt;**\n\n1.  Update a file, add the file again → **cm add ..**\n\n1.  Edit tracked version of file → **cm edit &lt;file&gt;** - don't think I'm going to\n    use this, I'd rather edit the source file, test it, and then update using\n    **cm add ..**\n\n1.  Differences between local version tracked versions → **cm diff &lt;file&gt;** -\n    this tells me which files I need to **cm add** again. This feels clunky and I\n    suspect there is a better workflow. Parsing git style diff files is\n    horrible.\n\n1.  Clobber local version with the tracked version → **cm apply**\n\n1.  Dry run and see diff between local version and tracked version → **cm -nv apply**\n\n1.  Pull the latest changes from your repo and apply them → **cm update**\n\n1.  Remove a file →\n\n    - Create **.chezmoiremove** in the source directory\n    - **chezmoi apply --remove --dry-run --verbose**\n\n1.  Type **cm** instead of **chezmoi** → **alias cm=\"chezmoi\"**\n\n# Links\n\n- [Github](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi)\n- [Project Site](https://www.chezmoi.io/)\n",

      "\n\n# 2014 - 2017\n\nHaving made arrangements to leave London, it seems like a reasonable time to\nreflect on my time here.\n\nLondon is a tough city to live in — it's big enough that a sub 1-hour commute\nis considered good, and it's super expensive. My stay in London has been\ndefined by my quest to complete my graduate scheme and qualify as an\naccountant.\n\nWhen I first arrived I had no idea what London or working in a corporate would\nbe like. I was coming from academia, and my motivation for moving to finance\ncould be summed up in two points:\n\n1. Understand more about the 2008 financial crisis\n2. Get paid more for using mostly the same skills (math) as in engineering\n\nI don’t think there’s anything wrong with these motivations, but I should have\nbeen making a long term career plan instead.\n\nWhen I started my job I was surprised at the 6 weeks of induction and\nhot-desking. Life as an auditor felt nomadic, as everyone would spend large\namounts of time at client's offices, and no-one has their own desk in our\noffice. The only thing you really own is your knowledge and your network of\nrelationships.\n\nIn 2014, I arrived with a high opinion of my employer and the view that I would\nbe staying for several years. Having escaped the financial insecurity of\nshort-term research grants, I’d moved back to my home country to contribute to\nthe system that educated me. I was happy to have a regular job with a decent,\npredictable salary.\n\nA phrase that kept coming to mind back then was “accountant factory”. Our\ntraining materials were scripted and everything was a standardised process. We\nwere being processed. Graduates in, corporate accountants out.\n\nThe company is huge and so are the efficiencies and barriers to competition\nthat come with this. When I arrived I was impressed there were free biscuits,\nand it felt presumptuous to put a meeting in someones diary. Now I ignore any\ncommunications addressed to a mailing list.\n\n## Accountant\n\nThe toughest experiences were related to the accountancy qualification. Naïvely\nI had believed that the qualification wouldn’t be a big deal and I didn’t give\nany thought to it when I applied — I just wanted to find out how banks worked.\nIf there were some exams to be done then it would be fine, I’d already achieved\na PhD and I would handle it.\n\nThat turned out to be a mistake. A huge mistake. The alarm bells should have\nrung louder when I realised most of my graduate colleagues had only applied so\nthat they could get the qualification (and were already intending to leave asap\nafterwards). Doing the pre-course work before college wasn't trivial. College -\nI was being sent to a classroom again. We were being taken out of the office,\naway from clients, and put in a classroom to prepare for these exams…\n\nStarting a job that required becoming a chartered accountant, without\nconsidering the effort and time involved to qualify was dumb. It’s an oversight\nI find hard to believe.\n\nThe disappointment and sadness at having to study again was profound. The\nteaching and assessment style was several steps behind what I’d become used to.\nCompared to the depth, autonomy and research-focus of a doctorate, writing\ncookie-cutter essays in time-pressured exams felt stupid. The exams were hard\nand I failed several of them, probably because of my low morale whilst\nrevising. Retaking them required more weekends and annual leave being spent\naway from my family, camped-out in libraries and offices.\n\nThis required much patience and generosity from Ritsya, who having not seen me\nfor long periods during my doctorate expected us to have a more normal\nlifestyle when we came to London. I found it miserable to pause my social life\nand other interests whilst studying, and then I would try to rush back to them\nwhen I had the time, knowing that soon I’d have to pause them again.\n\nIf I hadn’t already studied in Vienna, this process of working and studying in\nLondon would have been exciting and felt valuable or special. I’d passed enough\nexams though to know that they’re never as important as they’re made out to be,\nand whatever it was that was missing from my life wasn’t going to be found in\nanother qualification.\n\nOn the upside though, the ACA is the most practical qualification I’ve gained\nand has taught me many useful aspects of business and finance. I’m glad to\nfinally see business not as some mysterious system but something attainable and\nunderstandable.\n\n## Neighbourhood\n\nLiving in London has also required a lot of time on trains — my door to desk\ncommute is about an hour each way, and I’ve never lived somewhere in London\nthat hasn’t felt transient. We’ve needed to live near a station and didn’t want\nto commute more than an hour and that’s put us in neighbourhoods with other\nyoung professionals who also don’t have long term plans (or financial ability)\nto stay in the city. We’re all looking to move on and move up as fast as\npossible. I want to leave London partly because there are so many people with\nthe same attitudes and priorities as my own…\n\n## Corporate Culture\n\nBack in the office I spent the first few months figuring out how people were\norganised, how teams operated and how decisions were made. I think it took me\nabout a year to feel like I understood how things really worked, and 1.5 years\nto feel like I could do all aspects of my job with certainty. There is a\ndifference between how things are spoken about, and how things actually happen.\n\nMy experience has been that performance is all that matters and behaviour is\ndefined by self-interest. I don’t think this is different from previous\nenvironments I've worked in — academia isn't any different[^1] and the\nconstruction industry certainly isn’t. I wonder if the only way people can\nendure it is if they’ve not experienced anything else, or think it normal, or\nnecessary. I find myself wishing we could be kinder to each other, and that we\ncould create structures that incentivise mutual support.\n\nCorporate finance usually appears clean and well presented. Its people appear\ndependable and capable. The culture is sanitised and there's a lot of pressure\nto conform - you can see it in the clothes and accessories we wear and the\njokes we tell each other in the canteen.\n\nI came to see my office as a glass and steel cathedral. I read about the Middle\nEast, and migrants arriving in Europe, and tower blocks burning, and felt\nreally disconnected.\n\nDespite the high regard with which we hold ourselves, we don’t ask each other\nhow we can help. Maybe we are too busy, or feel powerless to help. Apparently\nwe do not know how to help, despite our wealth, talents, education and\nconnections.\n\nI remember watching a man leave the office one day and thought that if he gave\nhis whole career and left his firm after decades of service, there would be\nnothing left to identify him after a few weeks. The work will always get done.\nMarket forces will dictate how the business adapts and grows. The City rolls\non.\n\n[^1]:\n    Publications trump almost all other metrics, and the incentives to\n    publish quantity over quality are such that risky or slow research is\n    inexcusable. The metrics used to standardise success and allocate resources\n    can be subverted just as well in academia as in any other industry. What\n    management measures, the team prioritises.\n",

      "\n\nLast year I decided to learn the tools required to work as a data\nscientist. I was confident I already had the mathematical and analysis\nskills I needed, but I wasn't familiar with the tools of the trade.\n\nSome googling brought me to Coursera, and the [Data Science\nSpecialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)\nrun by Johns Hopkins University.  It consists of 9 courses, and so far\nI've completed five. If you do the courses in order then prior knowledge\nisn't required, and I think the courses strike a good balance of brevity\nand depth.\n\nThe main downside to me is that the courses exclusively use R (which is\npopular in academia) and I would rather be using Python (which is more\npopular in Industry).\n\nEach course lasts about 3 weeks and deals with a specific aspect of data\nscience, such as statistical inference or machine learning. Key concepts\nand tools in each subject are explained and developed, and whilst it's\nnot as thorough as a longer course would be, there is more than enough\nmaterial packed into the lectures, quizzes, assignments and projects to\napply to real applications.\n\nI've read that the second half of the specialisation is a lot more\ntechnical than the first, so I'm looking forward to setting aside some\ntime, working through the assignments and acquiring some useful skills!\n",

      "\n\nLast week I arrived in Dublin and had two days to find a coworking space. I ran around Dublin visiting as many as possible.\n\nI'm looking to rent a hotdesk, which means I don't have any storage space at the office and I don't have a particular desk.\n\nBelow are my impressions of eight businesses offering either hot desks or dedicated desks, ranked in order of preference. It's subjective. The going rate in Dublin seems to be €200 — €300 per month for a hot desk. Hours range from 9am - 7pm Monday - Friday, to 24/7.\n\n### First place: [Dogpatch Labs](http://dogpatchlabs.com/)\n\nDogpatch offer a coworking space and access to a community of tech startups. They run regular networking and mentoring events and occupy 3 floors of a warehouse next to an old dock. The offices have a range of interiors styles. The middle level is fairly standard but pleasant open plan offices, the top floor is a flexible working space with event areas. The lower level is a series of vaults that each contain meeting rooms of various sizes. There's a lot going on and there's a good buzz in the air.\n\nThe range of interior spaces is a big plus for me and I'm looking forward to being able to switch up my working environment through the day. There's a couple of kitchen areas, and a table football and table-tennis table on the top level. Access is 6am - midnight, and a hot desk is €200 per month. A dedicated desk is €400.\n\nDogpatch occupy less than a quarter of the warehouse building, the remainder of the space is used as a shopping mall and a museum. In my opinion Dogpatch is by far the best value and if you're working in tech it'll probably be your go-to solution.\n\n### Second place: [Studio9](http://studio9.ie/?page_id=223)\n\nThese guys are great. The space is a lot smaller that Dogpatch, comprising only ~12 desks. It's a basement, but don't let that put you off — its open plan and has large windows at either end. The space is well designed and uses a lot of light colours and textures, including wood on the walls and floors. There are also plenty of pot plants. These combine to give a bright and airy atmosphere that feels very natural and bright.\n\nThere are alcoves down one side of the main room which serve as meeting rooms, and a garden and basic kitchen at the back. The owners want the space to foster a community, and I expect that this is achieved. There are no dedicated offices and no teams using multiple desks, everyone is an independent worker.\n\nThe desks are large, and each has its own little wall to provide some privacy. €200 per month ongoing, or €250 for just one month. They offer a trial day for free.\n\n### Third place: [OfficeSuites](http://www.officesuites.ie/locations/20-harcourt-street/)\n\nThe building looks well run and appears clean and fresh with adequate resources. The building is an old Georgian tenement with high ceilings, cornicing and lots of natural light. The furnishings and decor lean towards corporate rather than something more interesting, but this works well to add a professional feel to the homely architecture. Access is 24/7.\n\nThere's only two rooms for hotdesking, and most of the building is given to private offices. There's a garden with bike storage, meeting rooms and a quiet room for calls. Lockers are extra. They also offer a free day as a trial.\n\n€249 p/m for desk access 9am-7pm Monday - Friday\n\n### Fourth place: [Element78](https://www.element78.co/)\n\nFriendly and well resourced, but very corporate. The architecture is corporate glass and steel. They're situated on the ground floor in a posh business district with large financials for neighbours. It's too corporate for me, but if you wanted an impressive place to meet clients and a nice address, this could be it. There were about 15 hot-desks for rent, plus plenty of dedicated desks. Clients seemed to include mostly young tech companies and tech freelancers.\n\nI'm hoping to find somewhere with more of a community, more inspiring architecture, and more character. I was offered a free day as a trial.\n\n€200 for the first month then €350 p/m\n\n### Fifth place: [Glandore](https://glandore.co/flexible-workspace.aspx#Hot-Desk)\n\nGlandore offer a relatively luxurious package with a corporate feel. They have a few buildings in Dublin and only the flagship has hotdesking space. There's a super looking restaurant and a large club room to relax in, but these are features that I don't need, and the rates aren't competitive if all you need is a desk and somewhere to take calls. It's set up for teams and for impressing clients, and independent tech workers are probably better off elsewhere.\n\n€295 p/m\n\n### Sixth place: [Regus](https://www.regus.ie/office-space/ireland/dublin/dublin-4-ballsbridge)\n\nRegus offer a polished on boarding experience and the friendly staff were quick to respond and generally helpful, but the office space was bland, grey and generic. The rooms I visited didn't have external windows and it reminded me of the rooms banks often put auditors in. If grey walls and tube lights are your thing then this is for you. 24/7 access, and meeting rooms equipped with A/V.\n\n€299.70 p/m.\n\n### Seventh place: [CoCreate](http://www.cocreate.ie/)\n\nI visited the southern branch and thought the building was a bit shabby and needed a new layer of paint. I recognised the desks as some of the cheapest available from IKEA. The rooms were small and needed cleaning, and there was weird art on the wall.\n\nThe thought of paying €200 a month to sit at a small wobbly desk put me off. The place was also almost deserted. Maybe their other branch is better, but this is not for me.\n\n€220 p/m.\n\n### Last place: [tCube](http://tcubedublin.com/tcube/index.html)\n\nLast and least, tCube seems to be putting in zero effort. When I visited I saw two rooms that needed painting, disorganised furniture and abandoned bits of computers lying around. The kitchen isn't high spec and the meeting room isn't big enough. I was also given a speech about how great the wifi was - a prerequisite that was taken for granted everywhere else. At €300 p/m for a dedicated desk its easy to find better value elsewhere.\n",

    content:
      "\n\nI've realised that one of the plugins I use to make this blog is not working\ncorrectly. I use the `more_categories` plugin to:\n\n1. add subcategories\n2. assign multiple categories to articles.\n\nSubcategories aren't working and Pelican thinks each article just has\ncategories than contain forward slashes.\n\nIn his \"Powerful Python\" emails, Aaron Maxwell recommends looking at the source\ncode for popular python libraries to see how really good Python is written, and\nhow talented developers write code and solve problems.\n\nThis is a good opportunity to look at the code that powers the plugin and see\nif if I can:\n\n1. Understand the source code\n2. Locate the source of the problem\n3. Fix the problem\n\nI don't know if Pelican is amazingly good quality or not, I get the feeling it\ncould do with more developer resources, but I've got a real reason and\nmotivation to look at the underlying code so I'm going to give it a shot.\n\nThe documentation is sparse which doesn't help, I get the impression that\nwhoever wrote it feels like Pelican is simple and it's obvious what's going on\n[ref]I guess it's the \"curse of knowledge\"[/ref]. It's not obvious to me.\n\n## Pelican Plugins\n\nEvery plugin has to have a `register()` function, here it is for the\n`more-categories` plugin:\n\n```python\ndef register():\n    signals.article_generator_context.connect(get_categories)\n    signals.article_generator_finalized.connect(create_categories)\n```\n\nI understand the idea of signals from Django, and generators are discussed a\nbit in the [documentation](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/internals.html#how-to-implement-a-new-generator). So what else is happening...\n\nAs I write down my understanding of the plugin, I'm aware that my understanding\nis definitely incomplete and probably wrong. I hope that as I progress I will\nsee the mistakes in what I've already written.\n\n`get_categories()` is called first, and it takes two arguments, `generator` and\n`metadata`. The entire function is 3 lines so here it is:\n\n```python\ndef get_categories(generator, metadata):\n    categories = text_type(metadata.get('category')).split(',')\n    metadata['categories'] = [Category(name, generator.settings) for name in categories]\n    metadata['category'] = metadata['categories'][0]\n```\n\nIt looks like it gets the category from the metadata for each article.\nPresumably by the time this function is called the articles have already been\nparsed and a `metadata` object has already been created and populated with\nmetadata about the articles, including categories.\n\nThe first row of `get_categories()` splits up the categories if multiple\ncategories are listed. `metadata` must be a dictionary, and there must be a\nmetadata dict for each article, otherwise you couldn't just get get the value\nassoiciated with the dictionary key and then split the string on commas.\n\nThis means that this function is called once for each article.\n\nI don't know what `text_type` does yet. Maybe it ensures that the output is\nalways a string. It's imported from `six` which I remember seeing being a\ndependecy of some other packages.\n\n.. Having checked the\n[documentation](https://six.readthedocs.io/#six.text_type) for `six` it looks like I was\nright - it represents unicode textual data in both `python2` and `python3`.\nPelican was originally written in Python2 I guess.\n\nNext step is to write a new key-value pair to the metadata dictionary for each\narticle. This plugin adds functionality to python by enabling `categories`\nand not just a `category` for each article. It seems clear that adding a\n`categories` key to the metadata dict is an obvious way to do this. The value\nfor the `categories` key is a `list` where each item is an instance of the\n`Category` class. This class is instantiated using two arguments, `name` which\nis the string from the previous row, and `generator.settings` which is\ncurrently not understood.\n\n.. printing the contents of `generator.settings` shows that its a dictionary of\nall the settings. Easily assumed and good to confirm.\n\nI'll dig into the `Category` class in a moment, but first lets quickly cover\nthe last row of the function. The `category` attribute of the articles metadata\nis simply updated with the first item in the categories list (`categories`\nmust be a list because it can be indexed.)\n\n## class Category():\n\nThis class is the only class defined by the plugin (which is only 96 lines of\ncode). It has 6 methods, 5 of them are decorated, and it has no constants.\n\nThe decorators are `property` [3], `_name.setter` [1] and `URLWrapper.name.setter` [1].\n`URLWrapper` is imported from `pelican.urlwrappers` and I don't know what that\ndoes beyond \"wrapping URLs\".\n\n### @property\n\nDecorators are functions that takes methods or functions as inputs. Using\n`property` along with `setter` decorators lets a class have a property assigned\nto it whilst ensuring that arbitrary conditions or logic is upheld. If the `@property`\ndecorator is over a method called `foo`, then there would need to be a\ndecorator called `foo.setter` on a method somewhere in the class.\n\nThat doesn't seem entirely right though, because in our `Category` class, we\nhave a `@property` decorator over a `_name` method, and also a `@_name.setter`\ndecorator over another method called `_name`. But the other methods with\n`@property` decorators (`slug` and `ancestors`) do not have any associated setter\ndecorators or methods.\n\nThe setter for `_name` seems to create parent categories if the string contains\nslashes:\n\n```python\n@_name.setter\ndef _name(self, val):\n    if '/' in val:\n        parentname, val = val.rsplit('/', 1)\n        self.parent = self.__class__(parentname, self.settings)\n    else:\n        self.parent = None\n    self.shortname = val.strip()\n```\n\nHere, `self.parent` becomes an instance of the category class, that is\ninstantiated using `parentname` and `self.settings`. This is recursive to\nhowever many levels of subcategories are specified.\n\nThe `ancestors` and `as_dict` methods seem more confusing. `ancestors` isn't\ncalled or mentioned within the class definition, but is called from the\n`create_categories` function which is called after the `get_categories`\nfunction returns. I don't understand why it needs an `@property` decorator\nthough.\n\nThe class inherits from `URLWrapper` so that is probably the next best place to\nlook... Indeed, looking at the definition of `URLWrapper` shows that the\n`as_dict` method is overriding the definition in the base class.\n",

    category: "Technical/Web",
    content:
      "\n\n## Three categories of problem\n\nLast year when I was creating [moneybar](https://moneybar/nl) and\n[pippip](https://pippip.email) there were a few problems that took much more\neffort to solve than all the others.\n\nI think I could group problems into 3 buckets, based on how much time they take\nto solve. `Type 1` takes less than 15 minutes to solve, `type 2` takes between\n15 and 45 minutes to solve, and `type 3` takes more than 45 minutes (usualy\n_much_ more).\n\n### Type 3:\n\nWhen I start learning a hard thing (like web development), almost everything is\nin the third bucket and it's exhausting. You need to set aside big chunks of\ntime, you need to be focussed and undistracted, calm and wide awake, and you\nneed to be prepared for a long arduous journey.\n\nProbably your criteria for success should be \"am I dead?\" because then if\nyou're asking the question you're guaranteed to be successful and keeping\nmorale high is necessary for success.\n\n### Type 2:\n\nHopefully you can make good progress understanding the basics and internalizing\nthe relevant abstractions, and your problems quickly[ref]on which timescale?\nLife is long, does it really matter if it takes 1 week or 1 month to learn\nsomething meaningful? Momentum, and having fun, is important though.[/ref]\nbecome `type 2` problems. They each take from 15 to 45 minutes to solve.\n\nMaybe this is because you know enough to break some big general problem into\nsmaller problems (you are developing domain expertise) and your intuitions for\nhow to solve the problem are becoming better so your first or second attempts are\nlikely to be correct, rather than your fifth or sixth.\n\nKnowing how to google a problem so that you get the answer you need is also a\nreally important skill, which requires intuiting how an English speaking expert\nwould ask the question. This isn't trivial but I don't hear people discussing\nthis often.\n\nWhen most of my coding problems are `type 2`, it feels like I'm learning most\nefficiently and when I'm most productive[ref]from a personal growth point of\nview. I suppose from an employers point of view they want all problems solved\nfast, `type 1` problems.[/ref].\n\n### Type 1:\n\nAfter a while, the problems that need to be solved become `type 1` problems.\nThey take less than 15 minutes to solve, because:\n\n1. All the big problems have been solved and now you've only got smaller problems left, and\n2. Your intuitions are good and your expertise has increased and you know where to look for\n   answers.[ref]Open the right file, google the right query (and follow the link to\n   stack overflow), make some changes, run your static type checker and linter,\n   run your tests, and push. Done and on to the next item.[/ref]\n\n## Exceptional problems:\n\nBut there seems to be a consistent exception to this model.[ref]which is totally\nfine. It's just a mental model, and the map is not the territory[/ref] Let's\nbe silly and call them `type W` problems. These are the problems that eat up\nfar too many hours, and are tiring to solve, even when you are (in most other\nrespects) an expert.\n\nFor me, these tend to relate to blob storage solutions for web apps deployed\ninto production. I can think of several factors why this is so, and I'll\ndescribe the specifics before generalising.\n\nWhen a web app runs in production, the data is not stored on the web server\nbecause the things that make a web-server cheap and efficient are not the\nthings that make a database or a file storage bucket cheap and efficient.\n\nTherefore they are stored somewhere else and you need some plumbing to join\neverything together. There are some abstractions involved to make this work\neasily and securely. However when developing locally, you are doing everything\non your laptop. You have a web-server, relational database and file system all\nin the same place.\n\nThis is a big, fundamental, architectural difference between your development\nenvironment and your production environment. As a general rule, these are\nsupposed to be as similar as possible.\n\nThese differences make it much easier to make something that works locally but\ndoesn't work in production, and it's very hard to test if a thing will work in\nproduction without deploying it to your staging environment, which you are\nlikely less familiar with than your local development setup.\n\nDeploying to staging and debugging on staging is slower and harder than doing\nthe same thing locally. Logging (and filtering) will likely be more important.\n\n## Solving exceptional problems\n\nSo how do you solve these problems quickly and efficiently? What is it about\nthis problem that makes it so hard? Let's examine what makes the problem\ndifficult to solve:\n\n1.  Iteration cycles are slow - I can't test locally, I have to deploy to\n    staging and this takes time.\n\n2.  The problem occurs in a 'high friction' environment - its difficult to dig\n    around and figure out what's really going on when its hidden below 3\n    different layers of abstraction, on a remote machine that I have limited\n    access to via a web browser. I want to be able to dig and investigate\n    quickly and easily using the same tools I use for writing and testing code\n    locally. I've taken great efforts to set up my local development\n    environment so that I can do this, and its stressful to switch to a\n    different and more limited set of tools.\n\n3.  The problem is the result of several things interacting at once, and I can't\n    just test things one at a time. These things are probably very similar to\n    the abstractions.\n\n    Thinking clearly, learning, buidling, solving problems, all rely on being\n    able to separate or untangle a seemingly complex situation into its\n    component parts so that you can figure out what causes what. If you can't\n    isolate individual concerns or components, you have a black box that is\n    keeping you ignorant.\n\n    In web development, customized logging is usually a good way to being\n    isolating and exploring particular components.\n\nHaving said all that, I think the best way to solve a problem is to prevent it\nfrom occurring in the first place, but I'm not good enough to figure out how to\ndo that, yet.\n",

      "\n\nDigital currencies are often discussed in the context of finance, technology and economics. The Blockchain - the technology which applications like Bitcoin are built on - is significant because it removes the need for trust or an intermediary between unrelated parties transacting with each other. So far, the most influential and famous digital currency is Bitcoin.\n\nThis post is intended to introduce the basic concepts of digital currencies and the problems a distributed ledger system needs to overcome.\n\n## What is a digital currency?\n\nA digital currency is an internet based medium of exchange. Units of digital currency are not printed, are not physical, and represent nothing. A unit of currency is produced by running algorithms to solve complex mathematical problems. When a solution is found, a unit of currency (for example, 1 Bitcoin) is generated.\n\n## If the currency represents nothing, why is it valuable?\n\nBecause people believe that in future, other people will believe it does, and because people are willing to trade real goods and services in exchange for it.\n\nThis is the same as for dollars, sterling and euros (fiat currencies) which also don't represent anything physical. (Although these examples are  supported by laws or regulation).\n\nIn the past, creating a new currency without the support of government hasn't been practical because:\n\n1.  A central bank was required to control the physical creation of new currency (otherwise people would create counterfeit currency, decreasing scarcity and moving its value towards zero)\n2.  An intermediary (a bank) was required for all large or remote transactions, to make sure that the amount of money each party owns is correctly recorded and updated in a ledger (preventing double spending of funds)\n\nThe technological breakthrough was preventing double spending without requiring an intermediary. This is made possible by using cryptographic techniques developed over the last few decades, and cheap, powerful computers which have only recently become available.\n\n## Central and distributed ledgers\n\nWith conventional currencies everyone's balance and transactions are recorded in one central ledger (a list showing how much money each account has) and each account holder only has access to their own balance and transactions. With digital currencies, a copy of the entire ledger (every transaction ever made by everyone) is held on each computer (or node), and anyone can see everyone's transactions.\n\nConventionally, if two parties wish to make a remote transaction then they need a bank to be the intermediary. The bank mediates by updating the central ledger to record the change in each parties funds as a result of the transaction. This is how one party knows if the counter-party is able to pay, and how payment is confirmed. If there is only one copy of the ledger, maintained by the bank, then the bank must be involved in every transaction between its account holders. This need for an intermediary increases the complexity and cost of doing business.\n\n## Sending money\n\nTo send money, a message is broadcast to the network that the amount in your account should decrease and the amount in another account should increase. Each computer in the network (a node) which receives this message will check its authenticity, make the changes, and pass the message along to other nodes.\n\n## What problems does blockchain solve?\n\nFor a transaction to be accepted and entered into the distributed ledger, its authenticity needs to be verified. Because the ledger is distributed, everyone can see everyone else's transactions. Therefore user authentication and transaction authorisation needs to be possible without compromising a user's ability to send secure payments in future.\n\nThere is also the problem of double spending - because the currency is neither physical, printed or representative of anything, how do you prevent a user from spending their currency more than once, or simply creating as much new currency as they want?\n\nAnother problem is the addition of new transactions to the ledger from many unrelated users. If each party has their own copy of the ledger, updating (or changing) it as they want, how would the ledgers completeness and accuracy be assured? How would you update your ledger to take account of transactions between third parties, and how would you know the order in which they occurred?[^1] The blockchain is remarkable because it is the first technology to solve all of these problems. Future posts will consider each of these problems are overcome.\n\n[^1]:\n    This is the Byzantine Generals problem, which is nicely described in the introduction of\n    [this paper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf)\n",

If this argument is not found, it looks for a\nslug_url_kwarg argument, and performs a slug lookup using the slug_field.\n\n## render_to_response(context, \\*\\*response_kwargs)¶\n\n- Returns a self.response_class instance.\n\n- If any keyword arguments are provided, they will be passed to the constructor of the response class.\n\n- Calls get_template_names() to obtain the list of template names that will be searched looking for an existent template.\n\n## response_class¶\n\n- The response class to be returned by render_to_response method. Default is TemplateResponse. The template and context of TemplateResponse instances can be altered later (e.g. in template response middleware).\n\n- If you need custom template loading or custom context object instantiation, create a TemplateResponse subclass and assign it to response_class.\n",

The requirements are definitely dumb; it\n    does not matter who gave them to you. He notes that it’s particularly\n    dangerous if an intelligent person gives you the requirements, as you may\n    not question the requirements enough. “Everyone’s wrong. No matter who you\n    are, everyone is wrong some of the time.” He further notes that “all designs\n    are wrong, it’s just a matter of how wrong.”\n\n1.  **Try very hard to delete the part or process**. If parts are not being added\n    back into the design at least 10% of the time, not enough parts are being\n    deleted. Musk noted that the bias tends to be very strongly toward “let’s\n    add this part or process step in case we need it.” Additionally, each\n    required part and process must come from a name, not a department, as a\n    department cannot be asked why a requirement exists, but a person can.\n\n1.  **Simplify and optimize the design**. This is step three as the most common\n    error of a smart engineer is to optimize something that should not exist.\n\n1.  **Accelerate cycle time**. Musk states “you’re moving too slowly, go faster! But\n    don’t go faster until you've worked on the other three things first.”\n\n1.  **Automate**. An important part of this is to remove in-process testing after\n    the problems have been diagnosed; if a product is reaching the end of a\n    production line with a high acceptance rate, there is no need for in-process\n    testing.\n\n<IframeEmbed src='https://youtube.com/embed/t705r8ICkRw' />\n\n[archive](https://storage.googleapis.com/assets.johnmathews.is/movies/Starbase-Factory-Tour-with-Elon-Musk-Part-1.mp4)\n",

      '\n\nBlockchains use Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) to authenticate users and\nauthorise transactions. These notes introduce the field of cryptography and\nexplains how modern cryptographic methods work. I wrote them to teach myself\nabout encryption [^1]\n\nTo begin with the absolute basics, encryption generally works by taking a\nmessage and representing it as a series of numbers [^2] which are then turned\ninto a series of random looking numbers. Decryption works by turning the random\nlooking numbers back into the original message.\n\n## Background\n\nThe history of Cryptography can be split into classical and modern eras. Modern\ncryptography began in 1977 with the introduction of the RSA and Diffie-Hellman\nalgorithms.  Until then, Cryptography required using a single key (the secret\ncode) to encrypt and decrypt the message. This was transferred from sender to\nreceiver secretly, but not cryptographically. In classical cryptography, the\ncode is a *shared* secret.\n\nThe modern era removed the requirement for a shared secret and instead used\nnumber theory as a basis for quantifying the strength of an encryption method.\nThe strength of a modern cryptographic technique is quantifiable and provable by\nreference to number theory, rather than a users ability to transport or transfer\na secret code.\n\nModern cryptography is defined by Public Key Cryptographic systems. They use one\nkey (code) for encryption and another for decryption. The encryption key can be\nmade public without any risk of the message being decrypted, and is therefore\nknown as the public key. The key used to decrypt data is the private key, and\nmust not be revealed. If a message is encrypted with the public key it can only\nbe decrypted with the private key.\n\nPublic Key Cryptographic (PKC) systems use algorithms that are easy to process\nin one direction but difficult to reverse, which are known as mathematical\ntrap-door functions. A simple example of a trap-door function is the product of\ntwo prime numbers. If two random prime numbers are chosen, it is trivial to find\ntheir product. However if only the product of the two numbers is known, it is\nrelatively difficult to find either of the factors used to create the number\n(this is factorisation). This was first noticed in 1874, when\n[Jevons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Jevons#Jevons.27_number)\nremarked:\n\n> "Can the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce the number 8,616,460,799? I think it unlikely that anyone but myself will ever know."\\*\n\nThis simple problem shows that finding the product of two (secret) prime numbers\nis computationally simple, but factorising the result is not. This type of\nproblem is a key feature of modern cryptography. Factoring prime numbers is a\nsuper famous mathematical problem, it was studied\nby [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes) [^3] in the 3rd\ncentury BC and more recently the [RSA Factoring\nChallenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge) has intended\nto track state-of-the-art factorisation techniques by issues cash prizes for the\nfactorisation of products of large primes.\n\nGenerally, the bigger the difference in difficulty between executing the\nfunction and reversing it, the better the cryptographic technique.\n\nThe RSA algorithm below uses factorisation as the foundation of its security,\nbut factorisation is not the hardest problem to solve relative to the size of\nthe keys required. Algorithms have been developed to factor the products of\nlarge prime numbers, and are much more efficient than randomly guessing possible\nfactors. The greater the size of the primes being factored, the more efficient\nthese algorithms become, and therefore the difference in difficulty between\nexecuting the function (multiplying two large primes) and reversing it\n(factorisation) becomes smaller as the size of the cryptographic key length\nincreases. This is a problem because as public key cryptography becomes more\ncommonly used the resources available to factor products of primes increases,\nand consequently larger keys are required.\n\nUltimately, encryption techniques based on the difficulty of factorisation will\nbecome redundant as the difficulty gap between creating and solving them\nshrinks. A better trap door function is required.\n\n## Overview of the RSA algorithm\n\nNamed after its founders ([Ron Rivest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest "Ron Rivest"), [Adi Shamir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir "Adi\nShamir"), and [Leonard Adleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Adleman "Leonard ")), RSA was one of the first public-key encryption algorithms and is\nstill widely used.\n\nRSA (as well as other cryptographic techniques) makes use of a number line which\nloops back to zero after reaching a maximum value, rather than increasing\nindefinitely. This means that once a maximum number $n$ has been defined, if a\nnumber greater than $n$ is created the result simply loops around to 0 and\nbegins counting from 0 again. i.e. if $n = 10$, then $7 + 5 = 12 - 10 = 2$. The\nresult of a calculation on a looping number line may easily be found by doing\nlong division and using the remainder as the final answer, i.e. $12 / 10 = 1$\nwith $2$ remaining.\n\n## Generation of a pair of RSA keys:\n\n### 1. Generate the RSA module\n\n- Select two large random prime numbers, $p$ and $q$. They need to be random because anyone who knows or guesses them will be able to decrypt the encryption.\n- Calculate $n = pq$\n\n### 2. Find derived number (e)\n\n- *e* must be greater than 1 and less than $( p - 1)( q - 1)$.\n- There must be no common factor for e and $( p - 1)( q - 1)$ except for 1. [^4]\n\n### 3. Form the public key\n\n- The pair of numbers $(n, e)$ form the public key and can be made public.\n- Even though $n$ is public, it is so difficult to factor the product of 2 large prime numbers that an attacker would not be able to find its component primes in the time available. The strength of RSA rests entirely on the difficulty of factoring $n$ into its two component prime numbers.\n\n### 4. Generate the private key (d)\n\n- The private key is generated from using $p$, $q$ and e as inputs to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. For a given set of values, there is a unique answer $d$.\n- $d$ is the inverse of $e$ modulo $( p - 1)( q - 1 )$. This means that $d$ is the number less than $( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )$ such that when it is multiplied by e, it is equal to $1$ modulo $( p - 1 ) ( q - 1 )$.\n\n## RSA example:\n\nRSA does not directly operate on strings as bits, it operates on numbers modulo\n(less than) $n$. and it is necessary to represent plain text as a series of\nnumbers less than $n$. The dominant encoding on the internet\nis [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), which represents each\nupper case Latin letter as a number between 65 and 90. Using this encoding, a\nmessage "HELLO" would become "$72, 69, 76, 76, 79$".\n\nThe maximum number $n$ needs to be the product of the two prime numbers $p$ and\n$q$. For this example choose $p = 7$ and $q = 13$, so $n  = 91$ [^5]\n\nThe public key component *e* can be any number we choose,  as long as there is\nno number other than 1 which is a common factor of *e* and $( p - 1 ) ( q - 1\n)$. In our example, this requires that there be no common factor between\n72 and e other than 1, so let _e_ $= 5$.\n\nTherefore our public key is (91, 5). This can be made available to anyone\nwithout messages being decrypted because of the difficulty of factoring the\nproduct of (very large) prime numbers.\n\nUsing the fact that we know 5 and 11 are the prime factors of 55 and e is 5, we\ncan use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm  to compute our private key $d$, which\nis 29.\n\nTherefore when the prime factors 7 and 13 are used, the public key is (91, 5)\nand the private key is (91, 29). These parameters fully define a functional RSA\nsystem.\n\n### Encoding\n\nTo encode a letter H in a message (\'H\' is $72$ in UTF-8), we need to multiply it\nby itself $e$ times ($e = 5$), remembering to wrap around each time we pass our\nmaximum value of $n = 91$.\n\n$72 \\times 72 = 5184, 5184 / 91 = 56$ with $88$ remaining, (i.e. $5184 = 91 \\times 56 + 88$). Therefore:\n$72 \\times 72 = 5184 = 88$\n$88 \\times 72 = 6336 = 57$\n$57 \\times 72 = 4104 = 9$\n$9 \\times 72 = 648 = 11$\n\nTherefore the encrypted value of "H" is "$11$"\n\nUsing the method for each character in the message "HELLO" results in the\nencoded message "\\$11,62,20,20,53\\$".\n\nTo decrypt the message, we take each number and multiply it by itself $d$ times,\n($d=29$) wrapping around each time we pass $91$.\n\n$11 \\times 11 = 121 = 30$\n$30 \\times 11 = 330 = 57$\n...\n$57 \\times 11 = 627 = 81$\n$81 \\times 11 = 891 = 72$\n\nAnd we\'re back to our original encoding.\n\n## Files\n\nThe spreadsheet I used to calculate the encrypted and decrypted values can be\ndownloaded [here](/documents/RSA-Example.xlsx).\n\nA simple python script to encrypt and decrypt a message is\n[here](/documents/AES_Example.py). It uses the AES encryption method.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[^1]: I used the explanations [here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/public_key_encryption.htm) and [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/) a lot.\n[^2]: A simple example is $A=1, B=2$ etc\n[^3]: Eratosthenes invented his famous [sieving algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) which finds all the primes up to a given limit.\n[^4]: If this is the case then e and ( p - 1) ( q - 1 ) are called "coprime"\n[^5]: Whilst the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is apparently simple to compute, its description is not. Therefore I\'ve used the same numbers in the following example as in the tutorials [here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/public_key_encryption.htm) and [here](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/).\n',

    content:
      '\n\nI recently set up a multi-sig Ethereum wallet and I couldn\'t find clear instructions. Here they are, I hope these instructions are useful for someone looking to get started.\n\nYou\'ll need a way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain in order to deploy a wallet. There are several apps that you can use. I\'ve used Parity because I found it simple and quick.\n\n## Ethereum Wallets\n\nWallets are a type of contract and there are two types of wallet, the Multi-Sig wallet and the Watch wallet. An Ethereum account is required to communicate with a contract so if you want a multi-sig wallet with 3 signatories (for example) then you will need to have set up at least 1 of those 3 Ethereum accounts before creating the wallet.\n\n## Parity\n\nFrom their website:\n\n> Integrated directly into your Web browser, Parity is the fastest and most secure way of interacting with the Ethereum network.\n\nYou can do a bunch of stuff with Parity including mining Ether, manage accounts, interact with different dapps, send/receive from different accounts, and set up contracts. On the accounts tab, you can quickly set up Multi-Signature wallets. If you use the Chrome plugin you will also get handy notifications when transactions are confirmed or contracts deployed.\n\n## Download and open Parity\n\nFor MacOS you can download and install Parity by visiting the Parity site and downloading the [installer](https://parity.io/parity.html), or from the terminal using curl or Homebrew.\n\n### Simple option\n\n```shell\n   $ bash <(curl https://get.parity.io -kL)\n```\n\n### Homebrew\n\nDetailed instructions are [here](https://github.com/paritytech/homebrew-paritytech).\n\n```shell\n   brew tap paritytech/paritytech\n   brew install parity --stable\n```\n\nIf you used the installer, then you open Parity opening the app and then using the logo in the menubar.\n\nIf you used Brew, then start Parity with the following command\n\n> parity\n\nand then go to the following address in your browser:\n\n> http://127.0.0.1:8180/\n\nYou should now see something similar to this:\n\n![Parity home screen view](/static/images/parity-home.jpeg)\n\n## Add or create accounts\n\n![Parity toolbar](/static/images/Parity-toolbar-accounts.jpeg)\n\n![Parity toolbar](/static/images/parity-account-creation.jpeg)\n\nSelect the Accounts tab from the top of the page and then select "**+ Account**". Either create new accounts or import them using your preferred method. You don\'t need to import all the accounts that will be part of the multi-sig wallet, but you will need to import or create the account that will own the wallet you are about to create. This account will need to have a large enough Ether balance to pay the transaction costs to deploy the multi-sig wallet onto the Blockchain. The costs are tiny, but they are greater than zero.\n\n## Create the multi-sig wallet\n\n![Parity toolbar](/static/images/Parity-toolbar-wallet.jpeg)\n\n![Wallet management](/static/images/parity-wallet-details.jpeg)\n\n1. Once you\'ve either created or imported the account which will deploy the wallet, select "**+ Wallet**" from the accounts tab and choose "**Multi-Sig wallet**". Click next.\n\n2. Enter a **name** for the wallet, if you want you can add a local **description**.\n\n3. The "**From account**" will be the contract owner and this account will\n\n   1. Be one of the signatories.\n   2. Need to have enough Ether to pay for the execution of the contract on the blockchain.\n\n4. Click the "+" button under "**Other wallet owners**" to add the address of the other signatory accounts. You\'ll need to add one line for each signatory and these accounts will also own the wallet once it is deployed.\n\n5. In the "**required owners**" section, specify how many accounts will need to approve a transaction that is above the daily transaction limit.\n\n6. Use the "**wallet day limit**" to set how much Ether can be spent by each account per day _without_ needing another account to approve the transaction. Set an amount of 0 if you want all transactions to require approval, or turn the option off using the slider to the right (which just specifies a huge number).\n\n7. Click "next" and you\'ll be shown a pop-up window to approve the creation of the wallet. You will need to enter the password of the account which is creating the wallet, and once you click "Confirm request" the funds in the creators accounts will be used to deploy the contract on chain and create the multi-sig wallet.\n\n![Wallet management](/static/images/parity-conf-box.jpeg)\n\n## Adding an existing multi-sig wallet\n\nOnce your wallet is created and deployed, you\'ll need to add it to other parity clients so that the other signatories can make or confirm transactions, and view the wallets balance. This is done by adding a watch wallet.\n\nProcess: Accounts tab > + Wallet > Watch wallet > enter the address of the multi-sig wallet.\n\nThe other signatories will now be able to view the wallet\'s balance, get notifications about pending confirmations, and be able to make and monitor transactions.\n\n## Managing a multi-sig wallet\n\n8. Anyone can put funds into the wallet, just like a normal account. Just send Ether to the wallet\'s address.\n\n![select multisig wallet](/static/images/parity-select-multisig.jpeg)\n\n![select multisig wallet](/static/images/new-parity-wallet.jpeg)\n\n9. At the top of the page you click "**Edit**" to change the local name and description of the wallet.\n\n10. "**Settings**" allows you add or remove owners (signatories) of the wallet and change the required number of approvals and the wallet day limit. If you change these settings then the changes will need to be executed on the blockchain and the account requesting the change will therefore need to pay the required funds. Depending on the settings being changed, other accounts will need to approve the changes before they are implemented.\n\n11. "**Forget**" will remove the multi-sig wallet from your accounts tab.\n\n## Moving funds out of a multi-sig wallet\n\n13. Click on "**Transfer**" in the wallet management window (pictured above) to begin withdrawing funds from the wallet.\n\n14. Select the token you want to transfer - Ethereum is the only default option.\n15. "**Sender address**" - specify which account wants to withdraw the funds from the multi-sig wallet.\n16. "**Recipient address**" - specify which account will receive the funds.\n17. "**Amount to transfer**" - specify how much you want to transfer. If the amount is greater than the remaining daily limit you will get a warning bar telling you the transaction will require confirmation from other wallet owners.\n18. If you want to specify the maximum transaction fee (a payment with a lower fee will be confirmed more slowly than usual) tick the "**advanced sending options**" box.\n19. Clicking "send" will bring you to the confirmation stage where you can enter the password for the account which is requesting the transfer.\n20. If approval from other wallet owners is required and they are also using Parity, then they can see that their approval is required in two ways:\n    - The signer tab will show there is a pending request.\n\n![Wallet management](/static/images/parity-signer-alert.jpeg) - The wallet management window (accessed from the accounts tab) has a "pending transactions" section where any confirmation requests will be shown.\n\n![Wallet management](/static/images/parity-wallet-management.jpeg)\n',

      "\n\n## Start with happiness\n\nIt seems to me that I am much happier as a Christian than I would be if I\nweren't. By \"being a Christian\" I mean following Jesus - trying my best to act,\nthink and speak like he want's me to because I'm grateful that he did what I\nbelieve he did. I believe he died for my sins and is now alive, having been\nmiraculously resurrected by his father[ref]And many other things also.[/ref]\n(who is now my father too).\n\nIt's not just an intellectual exercise. I believe that Jesus is alive because I\nseem to have experienced his companionship and intervention in my day-to-day\nlife. This is unusual, mind boggling, and makes things significantly more\ncomplicated than if I thought he were dead. Nonetheless it seems to be true.\n\nIt's not like I see supernatural intervention every day or anything, but there\nhave been various times - too many to discard - when my prayers have been\nanswered in practical ways (I'll leave out the intangible for now) that have\nsurprised me and given me a lot of respect for the risen Jesus doing what its\nsaid he'd do in the bible.\n\n## Obvious answers\n\nThere was this time I was in Yemen trying to get back to my room across town,\nat night and during a storm. I was lost and couldn't read Arabic to understand\nwhich bus to get. So I prayed, and two buses later I got off at the right stop.\n\nAnother example, I was getting a haircut in Liverpool Street Station in London,\nand as I was sitting in the chair someone took my work bag. When I came to pay,\nI realised my laptop and wallet had gone.\n\nTrying to find a stolen bag in central London feels ridiculous. Even so, I spent\na few hours wondering around the alleys and parks looking for it, and I\nresigned myself to some awkward conversations and using most of my next salary\nto replace the stolen computer.\n\nTo my surprise, my parents-in-law prayed about it and were really confident it\nwould come back to me, which seemed super unlikely. A few days later I received\na call from an office worker in the Gherkin building - my bag was under his\ndesk and he wanted to know if I'd like to collect it. I guess I'll try not to\nmake the same mistake twice.\n\nThe other example I tend to remember happened not long after I'd first moved to\nVienna. I was feeling lonely and isolated and I was wondering how on earth I\nwas going to find some sort of normal that was healthy and sustainable. Try as\nI might, I wasn't enjoying things at all and was feeling stressed and\noverwhelmed. I remember walking up this steep hill in the 18th district towards\nmy office, and repeatedly praying this really simple prayer 'God, please help,\nplease help, please help..'. It was that simple because I couldn't think of\nanything more useful to say.\n\nNothing dramatic happened that day, or even that week as far as I can remember.\nBut when I look back, it was a turning point when things started getting better\ninstead of worse.\n\nI suppose you can call this last example an intangible answer to prayer. Maybe\nit is, but I think anyone whose grappled with overwhelming loneliness or panic\nwould say that the emotions become all too tangible at times. Being in a\ndifferent emotional state seemed to make a tangible difference to just about\nevery area of life. Eating, productivity at work, relationships with friends\nand colleagues, etc.\n\nThis is only the beginning of why I think Jesus is alive and why I think\nChristianity is a real and living faith. It's not primarily a tradition, a worldview or a set of rules and ideals.\n\nChristianity is a relationship with Jesus. He did lots of amazing things that\nhave let me have a very practical relationship with him. It's an almost\nunbelievable premise from which to live a life. It has so many implications.\nAnd it holds up to scrutiny and my experiences bear it out.\n\n## Why write this?\n\nDespite Jesus' incredible works and their implications, modern Christianity\nseems to be in a really confused and ineffective state. Ideas and thoughts\nabout Christianity-the-faith have become mixed up with cultural christianity,\nor christian politics and traditions. These are each different things, and unless we distinguish between them with the words we use, we are going to find it hard to think and communicate clearly.\n\nI suspect that we are in a negative cycle of imprecise thinking leading to imprecise articulation, which leads to further imprecise thinking.\n\nUnless we can talk and think about one thing at a time, atomically[ref]from\nfirst principals[/ref] if necessary, we take on the additional risks of\nreaching the wrong conclusions personally, or arguing with others due to\nmisunderstandings rather than actual disagreement.\n\nWe should try to create a more precise vocabulary to navigate our Christian\nlives, so that we can think clearly about the experiences and questions we\nhave.\n\nImprecise thinking is frustrating, and conversations are less effective when\nthere's an increased risk of disagreement or misunderstanding what someone\nelse means. This makes it harder to talk about our faith, which makes talking\nless common, and this creates room for misunderstanding or apathy, or missed\nopportunities, or sadness.\n",

      "\n\n## /dev/null\n\nIn Linux everything is a file, including virtual devices like keyboards. Processes\n(programmes) can request access to or from these devices.\n\nThe only difference between these virtual device \"files\" and real files, is\nthat for a virtual device the OS generates the data that goes into the file,\ninstead of reading the data from storage.\n\n`/dev/null` is a virtual device that looks like a file and is used to write\noutput into a black hole that is discarded, lost forever and never seen. It\nisn't written to the terminal.\n\n## File Descriptors\n\nFile descriptors are integer values assigned to a file.\n\n- **stdin** has a file descriptor of 0\n- **stdout** has a file descriptor of 1\n- **stderr** has a file descriptor of 2\n\nTwo outputs are generated whenever a CLI is run `stdout` and\n`stderr`. By default, both these data streams are associated with the\nterminal. You can use file descriptors to redirect them.\n\nIf a command exits successfully, the exit status is 0.\n\nIf it exits unsuccessfully, the exit status will be something else.\n\nIf you don't specify which file descriptor you want to use, bash will use\n`stdout` by default.\n\nThe following redirects `stdout` away from the terminal and into `/dev/null`.\n\n```bash\n$ echo “Hello World” > log.txt\n```\n\nThis will redirect `stderr` into a file:\n\n```bash\n$ asdfadsa 2> error.txt\n```\n\nIf you run a command that generates lots of error messages along with \"good\"\nmessages, you can redirect all the error messages (`stderr`) into `/dev/null`\nso that you can only see the useful `stdout` messages. e.g.:\n\n```bash\n$ grep -r hello /sys/ 2> /dev/null\n```\n\nIf you want to run a command and only see the errors, (`stderr`) then you can\nfilter out all the `stdout` by redirecting the `stdout` messages to\n`/dev/null`:\n\n```bash\n$ ping google.com 1> /dev/null\n```\n\n## Redirect all output into /dev/null if you want a command to run quietly,\n\nRedirect all the output. The command below redirects `stdout` to `/dev/null`\n(the default file descriptor is 1 if it isn't specified) and then redirects\nfile descriptor 2 into file descriptor 1.\n\n```bash\n$ grep -r hello /sys/ > /dev/null 2>&1\n```\n\n## Read input from a file instead of the terminal\n\n```bash\n0<infile\n```\n\n## Direct stderr to append to a particular file\n\n```bash\n2>>logfile\n```\n\n## Combining file descriptors\n\n`2>&1` means send `stderr` wherever `stdout` is going. This means that you've\ncombined `stdout` and `stderr` into one data stream and you can't separate them\nanymore. It also means you can pipe `stderr` the same as you can `stdout`.\n\n# Input\n\nYou can redirect `stdin` similarly. If you run `</dev/null` then if the program\nattempt to read from `stdin` then it will get end-of-file.\n\nThe merge (or redirect) syntax (for example `<&2`) won't work, because you can\nonly redirect in the same direction.\n",

      "\n\nFinancial crises seem to happen fairly regularly so they shouldn't be\nunexpected. But no-one seems particularly concerned about our current financial\nsystem, at the moment our attention is controlled by other threats.\n\nI'm concerned that a lot of money has been injected into the money supply but\nwe haven't seen any inflation. And I am concerned that the price of stocks\nis no longer related to the value created by the company but instead by macro\neconomics.\n\nIt's a terrible time to be a value investor. This should be an alarming\nstatement. Value investing should _always_ be a decent way to make money\nunless markets are broken. If the price of something doesn't represent its\nvalue then a correction is inevitable.\n\nInterest rates are really low at the moment so if you have spare money and you\nwant to make it work for you then where do you put it? Not into a bank account,\nbecause interest rates are low[ref]Why are interest rates low? Because\nconfidence in the economy is low, so central bankers have to lower interest\nrates to make it 1. Cheaper for a business to borrow money to invest in their business and\ntherefore easier for a business investments to be profitable, and 2. So that\nits more attractive for investors to use their capital to invest in a business\n(which grows the economy) relative to depositing spare cash in a bank account (which is safer but a less efficient way to deploy capital). Interest rates affect the relative risk-reward ratios of\ndifferent investment strategies[/ref], and not into government debt, because\nthe yield is so low. It has to be stocks if you want the value of your\ninvestments to increase meaningfully.\n\nBut everyone is doing this which drives the price up, and because their price\nis increasing they increase even further.\n\nI think that the main reason for concern is super low interest rates and\nmassive increases in the money supply, but there are a couple of other factors\nthat are also contributing.\n\nIt's easier than ever for retail investors to participate in the stock market,\nand this seems like a good idea. Democratization. However if retail investors\nhave influence to effect prices, and they themselves can be manipulated or\ninfluenced regarding what or when they buy or sell, then that is likely a new\nkind of threat to financial stability. We've never seen social media combined\nwith quick, cheap investment services for amateurs before.\n\nIndex funds are also more popular than ever[ref][index funds are the new kings of wall street](https://web.archive.org/web/20210119144242/https://www.wsj.com/articles/index-funds-are-the-new-kings-of-wall-street-11568799004)[/ref] - the efficacy of index investing\nrelative to traditional funds that use stock pickers is very high over medium\nor long time horizons because index funds are much cheaper. But if index\nfunds become too large then they end up influencing the market in predictable\nand rigid ways.\n\nIndex funds cannot choose what they buy or how much they buy - they just track\nthe index. If a company's stock crosses certain thresholds, their stock has\nto be bought or sold. It seems like its possible to create feedback loops where\nfunds have to buy more of a rising stock, which increases its scarcity and\nprice, which then requires index funds to purchase more of the same stock.\n\nThe amount of euros in existence in 2019 was 90% more than in 2010.[ref][statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/254220/value-of-euro-coins-in-circulation-since-2002/)[/ref]\nBut inflation between 2010 and 2020 is\n13%.[ref][in2013dollars.com](https://www.in2013dollars.com/europe/inflation/2010)[/ref]\nWhy is that?\n\nIf the price of something doesn't represent its value, then a correction is\ninevitable.\n",

And that’s good.\n\n- Bigger items are\n\n  - Submitted an innovation proposal for an R&D subsidy. It would extend runway by several months\n\n  - Created a basic marketing site. Its v1, but it’s there to be iterated on now\n\n  - Completed a basic javaScript course\n\n  - React looks good\n\n  - Made my blog work again\n\n  - Updated my personal web site with reviews, and funky colors. Did it so that its done and I can forget about it\n\n- Last week I went down multiple rabbit holes reading about various web technologies\n\n  - This is tiring\n\n  - Probably a poor use of time\n\n  - But that’s only clear in hindsight\n\n    - Cube.js - amazing!\n\n    - AWS - big and confusing\n\n    - React - looks fine to me\n\n    - D3\n\n    - AWS Cognito\n\n    - AWS AppSync\n\n    - Create React App\n\n    - etc. yawn.\n\n- This week:\n\n  - No more rabbit holes\n\n  - Build something basic, not full featured and scalable\n\n  - Back to Django, and d3 for the first version of the dashboard view.\n\n  - I want more momentum\n\n- Lifestyle\n\n  - Good - I'm creating habits that are going to help me be healthy and productive\n\n    - Reading each day\n\n    - Running more and more\n\n- What have you learnt?\n\n  - Boring technologies are preferable to new and untested - react is more boring than vue\n\n  - how the graphQL api spec compares to REST apis\n\n  - Frameworks - Django is (still) the most sensible option for me. Not express, not flask.\n\n  - I’m seeing myself as wearing 3 hats\n\n    - Executive (strategy)\n\n    - Developer (writing the code)\n\n    - Manager - make the developer productive, and achieve the executive's goals\n\n  - I'm coaching myself and I find sport comparisons useful.\n\n  - I’m thinking of this as a sport in a lot of ways\n\n  - I'm borrowing a lot of advice from runners\n\n    - Consistency\n\n    - Gratitude\n\n    - Focus\n\n    - Hardwork\n\n    - Environment\n\n    - Rest\n\n    - Keeping it simple (I probably have the most beautiful CLI in the country, which is stupid)\n\n- Next week\n\n  - Build! Momentum!\n\n  - Django, basic d3.\n\n  - Should have done this last week..\n",

You have all\nexperienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I refer\nto it by this name because I once discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by\ndropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect,\nthan it would otherwise have.)\n\nBriefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the\nnewspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case,\nphysics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has\nabsolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the\narticle is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and\neffect. I call these the \"wet streets cause rain\" stories. Paper's full of them.\n\nIn any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a\nstory, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as\nif the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the\nbaloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.\n\nThat is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I'd point out it does not operate in other\narenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies\nto you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal\ndoctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one\npart, untruthful in all. But when it comes to the media, we believe against\nevidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper.\nWhen, in fact, it almost certainly isn't.

Is it\nimpossible for everyone?\n\nI started thinking about this when I had the following thought:\n\n_When we think we understand why something historical happened, all we've\nprobably done is accept a story that seems plausible._\n\n## Limitations and Reliability\n\nAn account of an event must necessarily be a simplification - not\nall details can be recorded or learned. This is ok because most details are not\npertinent and have no meaningful consequences.\n\nBut how do we choose which details are included, and how do we verify that the\ndetails were chosen correctly?\n\nHow can we be sure that a lesson or conclusion based on historical events is\nreliable?\n\n## Hypothetical model\n\nThe truthfulness of a historical story could be thought of as a value on a scale\nranging from completely false to perfectly true. I think that there are\nmechanisms that push popular or resilient narratives towards the middle of this\nscale and away from either extreme.\n\nAs a version of a story approaches the dishonest end it will contain an\nincreasing number of errors or omit an increasing number of pertinent facts.\nThis has the effect of:\n\n1.  Increasing the likelihood and frequency of someone hearing the story and rebutting its assertions.\n2.  Making it harder to align the assertions and implications with existing understandings of reality.\n\nAt the opposite end of the scale, a story is unlikely to be comprehensively honest because:\n\n1. Adding truth requires adding complexity. It is easier to create or capture a\n   simple story than a complicated story.\n2. As a story's detail and depth increases so do the resources required to\n   communicate it. Each narrative is competing for attention and a complex story\n   requires more resources to broadcast and listen to than a simple story. Those\n   with the resources to do so will want the story to benefit them in some way.\n\nThis creates incentives to omit inconvenient truths and distractions.\n\n## Implications\n\nI think that there is unfortunately no substitute for the hard work of coordinating disparate\ninformation, because the truthiness of a conclusion is generally proportional to the\ninconvenience of the effort spent forming it.\n\nWe are predisposed to choose convenience over inconvenience and this enables:\n\n1.  History to be written by the \"winning side\", who have more resources than the \"losing side\".\n1.  Complex events to be simplified into expedient and bite-sized narratives.\n\nAs time passes, the practical benefit of holding a view that differs from a\npopular narrative decreases. This reduces any incentive to challenge a popular\nview.\n\nThis creates a feedback loop that makes it increasingly difficult for a younger\ngeneration to discover information about historical events that challenge a\npopular narrative.\n\n## An heuristic\n\nHow much evidence did I collect myself, that wasn't brought to my attention by\nan algorithm or by someone else?\n\n## Awkward questions\n\n- Was WW2 a battle of the good against the bad, or the bad against the really bad, or something else?\n- Why did the Allies win WW2?\n- Was the influence of government on social freedoms in America 100 years ago dissimilar to China today?\n- Racial and ethnic discrimination was normal 100 years ago - it appears to have been so universally accepted that I'm led to question the presuppositions of modern attitudes about human nature and morality.\n\n[\n\n![cartoon by tom gauld](/static/images/tom-gauld-cartoon.jpg)/images/tom-gauld-cartoon.jpg)\n",

      "\n\nMy notes and additions from a twitter\n[thread](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936) created by\n[@naval](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936) on 31 May 2018.\n\n### Background\n\n1.  Seek wealth, not money or status.\n\n1.  Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep.\n\n1.  You must own a piece of a business - you wont get rich by renting out\n    your time.\n\n1.  You will get rich by giving society what it wants but doesn't know how\n    to get. At scale.\n\n1.  Money is how we transfer time and wealth.\n\n1.  Status is your place in the social hierarchy.\n\n1.  Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise\n    wealth, it will elude you.\n\n1.  Ignore people playing status games.\n\n### Actions\n\n1.  **Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.**\n\n1.  **Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.**\n\n1.  Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.\n\n1.  Maximise positive feedback loops. Design and defend against negative\n    feedback loops.\n\n1.  All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge,\n    come from positive feedback loops, or compounding.\n\n1.  The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most\n    people haven't figured this out yet. Write down some examples.\n\n1.  Play games where you iterate on past successes and experiences\n    to create more success and more experience. This is compounding.\n1.  Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all,\n    integrity.\n\n1.  Knowledge is not the same as intelligence.\n\n1.  Its hard to estimate higher levels of expertise relative to your own.\n\n1.  Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.\n\n### Specific Knowledge\n\n1.  Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like\n    work to others.\n\n1.  Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be\n    outsourced or automated.\n\n1.  Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion\n    rather than whatever is hot right now.\n\n1.  Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society\n    can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.\n\n1.  When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not\n    schools.\n\n### Accountability\n\n1.  Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society\n    will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.\n\n1.  The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah,\n    Trump, Kanye, Elon.\n\n### Leverage - capital, people, no marginal costs\n\n1.  Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with\n    accountability, and show resulting good judgment.\n\n1.  Leverage is the ability to increase the effects of something. \"Give me a\n    lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.\" -\n    Archimedes\n\n1.  Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and\n    products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).\n\n1.  Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over\n    form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste\n    your life chasing it.\n\n1.  Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital,\n    but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone\n    has to follow you.\n\n1.  Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the\n    newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you\n    sleep.\n\n1.  An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for\n    heat and space efficiency. Use it.\n\n1.  If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.\n\n1.  Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement. If you have good\n    judgement, reap additional benefits by leveraging it more. This is related\n    to comments by Geoffrey Hinton about the benefits of developing your intuitions\n    [interview](notes-from-an-interview-with-geoffrey-hinton).\n\n### Learning and practice\n\n1.  Apply specific knowledge with leverage, and progress is inevitable.\n\n1.  You should be too busy to \"do coffee\", while still keeping an uncluttered\n    calendar.\n\n1.  Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem\n    will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will\n    cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.\n\n1.  Who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you\n    work.\n\n1.  Work as hard as you can.\n\n1.  Thinking your own thoughts is tiring. Asking good questions is hard.\n\n1.  Doing is faster than watching.\n\n1.  Developing good judgement requires experience, if you have a chance to gain\n    real experience then take it. Learning can amplify the benefits of\n    experience.\n\n1.  Real experience is more useful than a prestigious course or degree.\n\n1.  Be patient and persistent, shape your circumstances. It doesn't mean you've\n    made a mistake if you can't do something real right now.\n\n1.  There is no skill called business. Avoid business magazines and business\n    classes. Think about why and extend this to other media.\n\n1.  Passive, peace-meal knowledge acquisition by itself does not lead to\n    specific knowledge or expertise. Subscribing to newsletters or social media\n    accounts offers quickly diminishing returns, at best.\n\n1.  Read long-form media which you actively looked for. Information that comes\n    to you for free has competing interests which put you second.\n\n1.  If you read only 1 book on a subject then you'll likely be a clone. If you\n    read 2 books you'll grapple with confusion. Read 3 and you'll begin to form\n    your own substantial opinions and intuitions.\n\n1.  Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do\n    until this is true.\n\n1.  There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich\n    off you.\n\n1.  Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics,\n    mathematics, and computers. Real experience with skin in the game will teach\n    you more than a book or a professor.\n\n1.  There are lots of ways to grow beyond being a beginner, but no one can do\n    the heavy-lifting for you. A course or product that offers to teach you\n    specific knowledge will give diminishing returns. The more of a beginner you\n    are, the better the course will appear.\n\n1.  Reading is faster than listening.\n\n### Remember why\n\n1.  When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were\n    seeking in the first place. But that's for another day.\n\n1.  Check in with your 70 year old self, and your 10 years older self. What do\n    they think of you now? Are they sympathetic? Proud? Do they say go faster, or\n    slow down? Be kind to yourself.\n\n1.  There is a big difference between saying \"I am intimidated\" and \"I am\n    feeling intimidated\". You can do it.\n\n## My top 2:\n\n1.  Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society\n    will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.\n\n1.  Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with\n    accountability, and show resulting good judgment.\n",

      "\n\nAn interactive [article](https://explore.paulbutler.org/bet/) that discusses the\noptimal strategy for the following scenario:\n\n\"I have a coin that lands heads 60% of the time and tails 40% of the time. You\nhave $25 and can bet on either side of the coin — every time you’re right you\ndouble your bet, and every time you are wrong you lose it.\"\n\nTheres a widget on the page that lets you select an amount, what side to bet on,\nand a chart showing your balance after each coin toss.\n\nMy first attempt at this game was probably my best. My intuition is that its\nalways optimal to bet on heads because each coin toss is independent, and 60%\nis more than 40%.\n\nHowever the question of how much to bet on each coin toss is\nmore complicated because you lose if your balance dips below 0. If you bet 50%\nof your balance and lose on 2 consecutive coin tosses, then you're out. The\nprobability of this is $0.4^2 = 0.16$. 0.16 is quite low, but whilst playing the\ngame you will toss the coin 50 - 100 times, so there are many opportunities.\n\nIf you toss the coin 50 times, there are 49 opportunities to lose twice\nconsecutively. I don't know the math for this probability, so I'll go learn it,\nbut intuitively I think that 50% of the pot is too high. I went with 33% and\nwon (reaching \\$250) in about 50 throws.\n\nI'd like to know how to optimise this, so I'll read the article.\n\nAlso:\n\n- [Insurance and the Kelly Criterion](https://blog.paulhankin.net/kellycriterion/)\n- [HN Comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30265797)\n",

      "\n\nContents:\n<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude=\"Overview\" toHeading={2} />\n\n# Don't post secrets to public GitHub repositories.\n\nI made this mistake a while ago, and in the interests of openness and learning\nfrom others, I'd like to describe what happened. Maybe it'll help others avoid\nthe mistake, and maybe I'll learn something from any conversation this article\ngenerates.\n\n# Background\n\nUsing Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I've been doing some work across multiple\ncompute instances. Thankfully, the work wasn't business critical or on\nproduction systems. My account was isolated away from the rest of the\nbusiness.\n\nAs the number of servers I was working with increased, I realised I needed to\nbegin using some tools to automate server setup. This lead me to begin using\nAnsible, and once I'd cobbled together a working playbook I pushed my Ansible\nproject to my GitHub account... And accidentally leaked the key for an\naccount I'd been using.\n\n# The hack\n\nWithin a couple of minutes of pushing the repository to GitHub I:\n\n- Made the repository private.\n- Stopped tracking the keys in git and removed them from the cache `git rm -r --cached <dir>`.\n- Received an email from Google saying they'd found leaked credentials.\n\nOK, close call. The secret was leaked for less than 5 minutes. On my obscure\npersonal GitHub.\n\nI thought there was nothing to worry about.. But then I noticed some activity\nin the console.\n\nCompute instances were being created, I could see the list growing rapidly.\nOver the next few minutes 195 compute instances and disks were being created,\neach with a unique name in zones across the world. The format of the name was\n`node-<type>-<number>`. Where type was either application, backup, jenkins,\ngke, prod, staging, worker, www, build, redis, or runner. Maybe some others\ntoo. The number seemed to be 5 random digits.\n\nSome of the instances were ephemeral. They all had delete protection enabled. I\nchecked the details of a few of them and noticed some scripts that included\nreferences to Monero.\n\nSo I guess a Monero mining bot was being set up.\n\nThe logs showed that GKE and networking resources had also been requested, but\nthe account which the stolen credentials belonged to didn't have the necessary\npermissions. Our project also maxed out its quota of compute instances in\nmultiple regions and zones.\n\n# Remediation\n\nI deleted the account that had been leaked, and began quantifying the\ndamage. I wanted to know exactly what permissions the key had, which\nresources could be created, and could the leaked account be used to create\nother accounts? No, it can't.\n\nAfter looking around and becoming confident that it was _only_ 195 compute\ninstances with disks and delete protection that had been created, in regions\nand zones across the globe, I began to remove them. No other resources had been\nprovisioned.\n\nIt took me 10 minutes and some googling to create the following workflow:\n\n1. Get all the compute instances and dump them into a file. I expected to run a\n   script that iterated through the file line by line, setting variables based\n   on the content of the current line: `gcloud compute instances list --format 'csv[no-heading](name, zone)' > names.txt`\n\n2. In Vim, find the rows that contain the instances that I don't want to\n   delete, and remove these from the file. There are a handful of compute\n   instances I want to keep, and 195 that I want to remove. `:v/node-` shows\n   any rows that _don't_ include \"node-&rdquo;\n\n3. Loop through the file and for each row, which contains the instance name and its zone,\n   - Remove delete protection\n   - Delete the instance\n\n```sh\nwhile IFS=, read -r name zone\n  do gcloud compute instances update $name --zone $zone --no-deletion-protection \\\n  && gcloud compute instances delete $name --zone $zone --quiet\ndone < names.txt\n```\n\nThe `--quiet` flag is necessary because otherwise gcloud will ask me to confirm\nthat I want to delete the instance otherwise.\n\n# Questions\n\nI'm surprised by the speed with which the attacker found the leaked\ncredentials. The repo did not belong to the clients account but my own, and I\nassume that my account is obscure enough to not be on any interesting lists. If\nmy account is being scanned every few minutes, presumably all accounts are\nbeing scanned regularly.\n\nHow many resources are required to do that? I guess if one of these attacks\nworks you can use the stolen compute to scan more repositories for more leaked\ncredentials. It's easy to imagine scenarios where large corporations that are\nalready running complicated cloud infrastructure deployments wouldn't notice a\nfew (200?) unauthorized compute instances running.\n\n# Study\n\n- [Service accounts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIivdWyY5sqIlPnZ7cvkg2Ck-8ZZ8TA5t) on Google Cloud Platform.\n- [Ansible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goclfp6a2IQ&t=1962s) videos.\n- [SSH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQWRp-FdTpc) crash course.\n- [Vagrant](https://youtu.be/vBrezgoX) crash course.\n- [IFS=](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26479562/what-does-ifs-do-in-this-bash-loop-cat-file-while-ifs-read-r-line-do/26480210) syntax explanation.\n\n# Comments\n\nThere was some useful [discussion](https://lobste.rs/s/5vwctk/i_leaked_credentials_onto_public_github) about this article on Lobste.rs.\n",

One of the best sessions was with [Boris Golden](https://twitter.com/Boris_Golden) called \"Understand Investment\". These are my notes:\n\n1. VC's are seeking to identify high-potential startups, and then support and fund them.\n2. They are looking for something that is innovative and unproven.\n3. A startup is not a company but an organisation searching for a business model,\n4. Whilst executing and discovering a scalable way to grow.\n5. Startups need money for ambitious but credible growth plans.\n6. A typical stake for a VC could be roughly 20%.\n7. VC's want an exit price of at least 100m, otherwise their business models don't work out.\n8. $10m can seem a lot for a founder with a 30% stake, but it's not enough to attract VCs, so aim higher.\n\n## How to pitch\n\n- Identify specific people with real needs\n- Size of market\n- Why now?\n- What is your clear competitive advantage - why can no-one else do this?\n\n### Market\n\n- Find a large and attractive market…\n\n### Management\n\n- Build a smart, skilled and cohesive team\n- With a strong ability to deliver quickly and to learn quickly\n- That is ready to go big whatever it takes\n- With a unique vision and project-fit\n\n### Model\n\n- Valuable and differentiated products\n- Efficient go-to-market and growth channels\n- Profitable monetisation strategy\n- Scalability and defensibility\n\n### Momentum\n\n- Show traction and that you've cracked the important problem\n- Show ambitous and credible growth plans\n- With a capital-efficient growth model\n- And a clear strategy to scale and win\n",

      "\n\n## Code Structure\n\nOne of the most immediate and basic differences between working as a data\nscientist or as a web developer is the number of files the codebase\nis spread across and the amount of code within each file.\n\nWeb applications tend to be very modular - there are a lot of different things\ngoing on in a modern web app and generally they all need to be able to be\nmodified or updated independently of each other. This requirement encourages\nmodular code base architecture with the code broken down into testable units.\n\nWhen working on a data science project you often have a well defined and quite narrow pipe line. Each stage of a pipeline has well defined inputs and outputs.\n\nThis seems to have the consequence of making data science projects tend towards a handful of files each with a substantial amount of unique (not boilerplate) code. In web development there seems to be more boilerplate, many more\nfiles spread across a tree of directories, and the average number of lines of code per file is significantly lower.\n\n## IDE features\n\nThese differences mean that code organization tools and IDE features play very\ndifferent roles within each industry. In web development you really need to be able to jump between different files (or buffers) quickly, and search for text across multiple files. Writing idiomatically becomes more important, and writing code within discreet testable units becomes essential so that things don't break without being noticed.\n\nIn data science, linting feels more optional, and searching for text within methods or functions outside the current module is rarer.\n\nI didn’t appreciate this until I paused my work as a Data Scientist and began building non-trivial web apps.\n",

      "\n\nContents:\n<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude=\"Overview\" toHeading={2} />\n\n## In the beginning\n\nI came to web development via business analytics. I was working as an\naccountant and Excel wasn't good enough anymore, so I looked around for a way\nto get started and came across [Jupyter\nNotebooks]({filename}jupyter-ipython-notebooks-pandas.md).\n\nNotebooks are said to be a kind of \"gateway drug\" to programming, and I think\nthat's true. They're the easiest and fastest way to start programming that I've\ncome across.\n\nWhen you're working in a notebook, its easy to get data, wrangle it, and show\nsome results. But as soon as you can create a chart or some summary table you\ninevitably wonder how you can show this to people more easily, and publishing\nthe results to a website feels like the best most general and versatile\nsolution.\n\nUnfortunately it's also the hardest, and so begins a long series of compromises\nand incremental progress. Learn to use a dashboarding API, and learn to create\nstatic sites. But the end-goal, the ultimate solution, is a data driven web\napp, with authentication, saved user preferences, scalable performance, and\nautomatically updated data sources.\n\n## A personal finances dashboard\n\nWhen I moved to the Netherlands, I wanted to use a personal finances dashboard\nto check weekly expenses. There wasn't a web-app that would do this (though\nthere are a couple of apps that are trying) so I built my own dashboard. Then a\nfew friends asked if they could use it too. They couldn't because it was just a\ndashboard and not a web app, but I thought this was a good reason to jump into\nweb development.\n\nIt was a much bigger task than I anticipated. (And that's OK.)\n\nIt took several attempts and was super frustrating, I would dabble for a few\nweeks, do a few tutorials, and then get completely lost when I tried to do\nsomething by myself. I'd get disorientated working across many different files\nand trying to visualise which part of the Model-View-Controller model, or the\nrequest-response cycle I was currently working on.\n\nI came to realise that the mental load seems so large at the beginning because\n\"web-development\" is really a whole stack of technologies and abstractions\ncombined (or stacked) together. Many of these have to be used together at the\nsame time before you can see _any evidence of success at all_.\n\n## Learning Django\n\nI think the hardest things about Django are not actually Django. You'll need to\ncomfortable with classes and inheritance. You'll also need to be comfortable\nwith working across multiple files, and have some tools for searching across\nall you open buffers, or all the files in the project, at the same time. You'll\nalso need to be comfortable with version control (Git) and using the command\nline. Get familiar with stack traces too.\n\nIf you're familiar enough with all these things, so that using them doesn't\nfeel new, but ideally feels familiar and comfortable, then I think you'll make\nquite quick progress with Django.\n\nDjango uses the Model-View-Controller model. Models are how django maps Python\nobjects to items in your database (oh yeah, you need to be familiar with SQL\ntoo...), Views are where requests are processed (also Middleware) and turned\ninto Responses, which are then combined with templates (unless your building an\nAPI). You might notice I haven't mentioned what a Controller is - get used to\ninformation feeling incomplete whilst you're learning the ropes. It'll become\nclear soon enough.\n\n## The best moments\n\nThe 'curse of knowledge' states that once you've learnt something you can't\nimagine or remember what it's like to not know it. Before that happens\ncompletely, I want to record some of the 'ahah!' moments of 'learning Django'.\n\nFor context, I stopped working as a freelance data scientist in April and after\na few weeks wondering if django and PostgreSQL and python was the way to go\n(yes it is. use boring technology), I began working full-time on what would\nbecome [MoneyBar.nl](https://moneybar.nl). I called it 'myeuros' in the\nbeginning.\n\nThe learning curve felt steep. I wanted to do things \"right\" the first\ntime because I wasn't building a toy, and although I felt that hindsight would\nshow this to be a mistake in terms of efficiency, I did it anyway because I\nhave a hunch that following my compulsions sometimes makes life harder in the\nshort term and better in the long term.\n\nThe best moments are usually preceded by the most frustrating.\n\n### Adding a unique identifier to an existing authentication model\n\nI used pydanny's `cookiecutter-django` template. Honestly, by the time I'd gone\nthrough the quickstart process and googled the nouns in all the questions (what\nis `Sentry`, what is `Celery` and what is a `task que`, what is `whitenoise`,\netc.) I was already tired. Play with it a few times and come back to it.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to start with authentication, because the project template has\nthat part kind of up and rnuning for you out of the box. `cookiecutter-django`\nuses the `Django Allauth` package, which is awesome, and reliable, and fully\nfeatured... and extremely abstracted. Good luck looking at the module code and\nunderstanding it if youre not an expert.\n\nI wanted to give each user a unique ID - a `UUID` when they signed up. This\nwould be used in query strings instead of usernames or incremental keys. This\nwas so hard the first time! And it turns out its not a trivial task, not if you\nalready have a few users in your (test) database. Sure you can reset the\ndatabase and start again, but experimenting like this is fairly complex.\nUnderstanding how the python model classes (the ORM) maps to the relations in\nthe PostgreSQL databse was complex, and if I got confused, should I try to fix\nit by changing python Models, or editing migrations, or working on the database\ndirectly? Getting started is one of the hardest things.\n\nAfter I'd figured out authentication, I started creating models for other\nsimpler data (transactions and bank accounts I expect). This was much simpler\nand faster. I remember driving home one evening thinking that if I could get\nthis far then success was inevitable.\n\n### Testing code\n\nBefore long, testing each part of the app by hand when I added or changed a\nfeature was no longer trivial. I needed to find some way of automatically\ncreating users and checking that they could log in and access views.\n\nI began working with `pytest`, and really found it hard to wrap my head around\nthe idea accessing different parts of the app not by requests and responses but\nby accessing class methods directly.\n\nI think its normal and good to code at the limit of your knowledge, where you\nknow just enough to make a thing \"work\". But this approach falters when you\nwant to then test what you wrote. Or at least, the measure of \"just enough\"\nreally changes when you require tests to be written. You don't just need to\nmake it work, you need to understand why it works, so that you can write tests\nto assert that certain conditions pass and others fail.\n\nThis feels really satisfying when it works, because you have proof that you\nreally have grasped a bigger picture. There are far fewer (relevant) black\nboxes when you write tests. But it also makes learning slower, at least in the\nshort term. It means you might have two get comfortable with a handful of\nabstractions, when you've already solved the problem you started with. This is\nfrustrating, and it takes discipline to slow down, take a deeper look at the\nsolution, and not just race on to the next feature.\n",

    content:
      "\n\nThe lightning network is a protocol that operates on top of the Bitcoin network. It allows instant transactions between participants and is the leading solution to current scalability problems.\n\nThis post is based on the excellent seminar by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja \"Scaling Bitcoin to Billions of Transactions Per Day\" which was given at the San Francisco bitcoin developers conference in early 2015. You can see the seminar [here](https://youtu.be/8zVzw912wPo).\n\n## The Problem\n\nBitcoin doesn't scale well enough to facilitate the rate of transactions necessary for it to become a medium of exchange in everyday life. This is because\n\n1. Transactions aren't instant - the average block time is 10 minutes\n2. Transaction fees are variable and too high (particularly when blocks are almost full) to enable low value transactions (micro-payments)\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin has a 1MB block size limit. This allows about 2750 transactions per block [(link)](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-per-block) or 4.6 transactions per second. This isn't fast enough for a global payment system.\n\n## Solutions\n\n### Bigger blocks\n\nIn 2017 there was a lot of contentious debate about how to solve Bitcoins scaling problems. One of the most frequently suggested solutions is to increase the block size, so that more transactions can fit into each block.\n\nIf you had 7 billion people making 2 transactions per day, you would need 24GB blocks, generating data at a rate of 3.5TB/day. This would make running a full bitcoin node impractical for many people which would result in centralisation, fewer miners and lower security.\n\n(Note: you would expect corporations and large miners to support efforts to increase block sizes, because the associated infrastructure cost increases create a higher barrier for entry to newcomers. This would decrease the competition for new blocks and protect their revenue from miners fees.)\n\n### More efficient databases\n\nSQL is a much more efficient database model than a blockchain. Its scalable and fast, and is what is used today to power visa, master card, central banks. But it isn't trustless. With a SQL database model you have a trusted 3rd party maintaining the database which everyone else needs to query to discover or verify a balance. This is equivalent to giving the 3rd party your money and trusting they do the right thing.\n\n### Side chains\n\nA blockchain with other blockchains running parallel to it. Maybe like a a rope made of many different chords. Side chains are not primarily a scaling solution. If you want to send a payment to an address that is on a different side chain you would create 2 transactions. Not any-to-any.\n\n### Payment channels\n\nMany payments between two predetermined parties. Useful when two parties pay each other multiple times, not necessarily good for paying many different accounts relatively few times each. Its not any-to-any.\n\n---\n\nWhat we want is payments from **anyone to anyone**\n\n### Lightning Network\n\n- Payment channels between many parties in a multi-hop hub and spoke model\n- Minimally trusted intermediaries - they can't take your coins, but they could conceivably delay setllement\n- Requires the malleability fix that occurred in 2017\n\nPrevious soft forks:\n\n1. Pay to script hash,\n2. bip34 (coinbase transactions)\n\n## What are payment channels\n\n- Uses multisig\n- Allows two people to send transactions to each other quickly without hitting the blockchain everytime\n\n### A 2 party unidirectional payment channel\n\nAlice and Bob create a multisig address that they each control\n\nAlice wants to send 1 BTC to the multisig address\n\nBefore she does this, she gets Bobs refund signature, this means that at worst, Alice loses her coin for 30 days.\n\nBob creates a 30 day nLock time refund signature, signs it, and sends it to Alice.\n\nAlice can either sign it immediately and keep it, or wait to sign it herself (keeping it half-signed).\n\nOnce Alice has the refund signature she knows its safe to send her BTC to the multisig address she and Bob just created.\n",

      "\n\nI attended the [Lisbon Investment Summit](http://www.lis-summit.com/) on June 6 and 7 as part of the [Oula.la](http://www.oula.la) InsurTech startup team with [John Sullivan](https://twitter.com/jd_sullivan?lang=en-gb). It was the first startup conference I'd been to and I arrived hoping to have some useful conversations and understand more about the Fintech and startup spaces in Europe. As usual I wanted to focus on tech, finance and blockchains.\n\n## Who was there\n\nAs well as some outstanding sessions there was a high ratio of investors to startups. This made talking to VCs, bankers and M&A lawyers really easy. I was happy to meet a London-based and Fintech-focussed VC when I sat down to have lunch, and thanks to interrupting a session to ask blockchain related questions on Day 1, a banker struck up a conversation with me over breakfast the next day. I met a lot of people across many relevant roles, and once I've worked through my notes and my new collection of business cards I hope to have some great follow-up meetings.\n\n## Useful Sessions\n\nThe most useful sessions for me were:\n\n- [\"What it means to be ambitious for founders in Europe\"](ambitious) by [Oussama Ammar](https://twitter.com/daedalium?lang=en) from [TheFamily](https://www.thefamily.co)\n\n- [\"Understanding Investment\"](investment) by [Boris Golden](https://twitter.com/Boris_Golden) from [Partech Ventures](https://www.partechventures.com)\n\n- \"Building successful businesses on blockchain technologies\" a panel discussion moderated by [Kevin Loaec](https://twitter.com/kloaec?lang=en), founder of the [Chainsmiths](http://chainsmiths.com/) blockchain consultancy, and including [Mir Serena Liponi](https://twitter.com/mir_btc) from [Blockchain Lab](http://www.blockchainlab.it/)\n\nThe blockchain session was valuable because it's unusual to meet people who have been working in the blockchain space for several years. I'm always wary of being distracted by the hype and noise around developments in the blockchain space so I appreciated hearing some informed and level-headed opinions.\n\n## Political Support\n\nThe opening session included a speech from the Mayor of Lisbon and the next day opened with a speech from the Secretary of Industry. Both speeches conveyed an open and progressive attitude to international cooperation aimed at promoting and supporting founders and startups in Portugal. The warm words were supported by practical measures including tax incentives and a state-backed scheme to match amounts contributed by private investors. It was really refreshing to hear a politician extol the virtues of multinational cooperation and bringing different cultures into Portugal. I wish Britain could do this too.\n\nOn the topic of Brexit, which inevitably arose due to London's present role as a centre of finance and innovation, it seems Europe is still expecting the UK to come to its senses, and cannot understand why it's destroying its goodwill and reputation so thoroughly.\n\n## Overall\n\nThe two days in Lisbon were full of useful and energetic conversations and it was a great experience pitching [Oula.la](http://www.oula.la) multiple times and talking about what we're trying to do and how blockchains are a part of that. The opportunities to meet founders and investors are invaluable for making informed decisions. Lisbon is a beautiful city which I found easy to get around and always felt safe in. It's also refreshingly [affordable!](london)\n\n![Panoramic street](/static/images/lis4.JPG)\n\n![Google talks](/static/images/lis3.JPG)\n\n![Statue](/static/images/lis1.JPG)\n",

      "\n\nContents:\n<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude=\"Overview\" toHeading={2} />\n\n# Background\n\nI posted a previous [article](analytics) (about building an analytics tool) onto the Hacker\nNews forum. It was quickly buried and didn't get any attention.\n\nTo my surprise, I received an email from a Hacker News administrator (Daniel) explaining that it\nwas a good quality post and would be boosted to the front page at a random time\nwithin the next couple of days.\n\nSure enough, in the early hours of the next morning, the post was boosted. I\nwoke up to various notifications that people had started following me on twitter,\nwhich never happens. After delegating the kid's breakfast duties, I logged into\nGCP to see what affect the extra traffic had on my experimental tool.\n\n# The Hacker News affect\n\nTraffic had increased by about 30x and my hastily built tool was looking very\nsub-optimal. Two problems stood out - the aggregated analytics data was taking\nanywhere from 20 - 30 seconds to load (up from around a passable-ish 5 under\nnormal conditions), and I was running up a bill of around €10/day.\n\n## Bad news\n\nThe reason for both of these problems was a shockingly inefficient and lazy\napproach to serving the analytics.\n\nEach time the analytics page was loaded, a cloud function would fetch _all_ the\ndata in the DataStore database, munch all that data and return a freshly derived\nblob of JSON. Never mind that almost the exact same computation had occurred hundreds\nof times already.\n\nAs the amount of data in the DataStore increases, so does the time required to\nserve the analytics page. In the second chart below (dashboard for the\n`get-analytics` cloud function), it looks like the execution\ntime increases at a rate of O(log n).\n\n## Good news\n\nThe good news though was that the `page-view-logger` function was handling the\nextra traffic smoothly. You can see in the dashboard image below (click on it)\nthat almost every request was completed in less than 200ms, which I think is\nfine for a background process. I could also see the active instances\nscaling up and down well within its preset limits, as expected.\n\n## API traffic for the tool\n\n[\n\n![API traffic](/static/images/analytics-tool/api-traffic.png)/images/analytics-tool/api-traffic.png)\n\n## Dashboard for the `get-analytics` cloud function\n\n[\n\n![dashboard for get-analytics function](/static/images/analytics-tool/get-analytics-dashboard.png)/images/analytics-tool/get-analytics-dashboard.png)\n\n## Dashboard for the `page-view-logger` function\n\n[\n\n![dashboard for page-view-logger function](/static/images/analytics-tool/page-view-logger-dashboard.png)/images/analytics-tool/page-view-logger-dashboard.png)\n\n# The Solution\n\nI began to ponder the importance of all the things I didn't know about\ndatabases, and what DataStore might be good and bad at doing. Scrolling through\nthe documentation I could see google boasting of super quick writes, but not\nsuper quick reads. I'd already seen how many API calls were being made to the\nCloud DataStore API and knew I'd probably have to redesign part of the tool.\n\n## Idea 1: Use global objects\n\nI attempted a few easy wins, mostly using the idea that if an instance of\na function was invoked multiple times before being powered-down then global\nobjects would still be available in memory.\n\nIf I put the data collected from the DataStore into a global object then I could\ncheck for its existence in subsequent function calls. This would save a lot of\nAPI calls and likely remove the largest bottleneck, saving my readers 10+\nseconds of watching a loading spinner.\n\nFor whatever reason, this didn't work. Even if it had, the tool could still be\nvastly improved by taking a different approach that would be even faster and\nalso reduce costs. I'd like to have this tool running indefinitely so\nreducing daily costs to an absolute minimum is important.\n\n## Idea 2: Store the results themselves in the database\n\nIt was obviously inefficient to repeat the same calculations multiple times. A good long-term solution would require aggregating the data periodically and\nthen fetching and serving these aggregated data to the client.\n\nI tried putting the JSON into the DataStore using a different key, but ran into\nerrors about the data for each entity being too large. Even if I split the\naggregated data into multiple component parts it would still be too large, and\nwould grow over time. I guess DataStore isn't meant to be used like this.\n\nI probably could have pursued this idea a bit further, but I didn't want to\nchange the structure of the JSON blob served to client. If I did change it then I'd\nneed to rewrite the client side JavaScript as well.\n\nClient side work is faster than back-end, but writing JavaScript is fiddly\ncompared to Python in my opinion. There's always multiple ways of doing a thing,\nand several versions of an API, so googling a solution isn't as simple as for\nPython.\n\n## Idea 3: Forget DataStore, use buckets\n\nFinal idea - store the results as a JSON blob in a Storage bucket and point the\nclient at the bucket instead of the Cloud Function.\n\nTurns out this is a super fast and efficient solution.\n[/analytics.html]({filename}/pages/website-analytics.md) now loads in less than\nhalf a second, and the only variable costs are egress on the bucket, which will\nbe much smaller than the comparable costs of running a Cloud Function.\n\nThe computation expense of calculating the analytical results is fixed and\ndecoupled from the number of page views using the following method:\n\n1.  Every few minutes Cloud Scheduler targets a Pub/Sub topic.\n1.  The topic triggers a Cloud Function.\n1.  The Cloud Function then:\n    1. Queries the DataStore and collects the data.\n    1. Calculates the analytics results.\n    1. Generates a JSON blob containing the results.\n    1. Pushes the JSON to a storage bucket which is available to a client.\n\n## Further improvement\n\nThe aggregated results for days other than the current day are still needlessly\nrecalculated - once midnight rolls around the results are clearly not going to\nkeep on changing.\n\nInstead of having one JSON blob containing data for all the last 30 days, I\ncould have a blob for each day (or perhaps each week). This would reduce the amount\nof data extracted from the DataStore. This would reduce costs and computational expense.\n",

      "\n\nLiving in London is expensive, everyone in the UK knows this. Everyone knows that this is mostly due to the price of property, which we all enjoy talking about.\n\nI've lived here for 3 years now, and when my wife and I were both working we lived comfortably. Two incomes under one roof is just fine. Not as fine as in many other cities, but reasonable. Just over a year ago my first child was born, and now that my wife's maternity pay has ended we are a single income household. This is not fine.\n\nEven though I earn almost £50k/year, and any salary increase will be taxed at 40%, I cannot cover essential day-to-day costs. I'm in the 40% tax bracket, and my basic monthly outgoings exceed my monthly take home pay by £400. If my employer wanted to pay me enough to cover essential costs, it would cost them approximately double the shortfall due to tax. None of this makes sense.\n\nSalaries and living expenses have become really disconnected.\n\nFor most people the most obvious way to increase wealth is to buy property. Mortgage repayments are cheaper than rent, and the value of the property increases over time. Double win. But there is a big hurdle to overcome before this is possible - saving money for a deposit on a house is often impossible without external help (i.e. the \"Bank of Mum and Dad\"), because so much of the money earnt must be spent on rent first.\n\nIt's a trap. Repayments on a mortgage are cheaper than paying rent, but you cannot save enough for a deposit because;\n\n1. so much of your salary goes to paying rent[^1], and\n2. the average cost of a _flat_ in London is 500k[^2], which means a 5% deposit is £25k — which is a higher deposit than you would need anywhere else in the UK, despite being the place you are least able to accumulate it.\n\nWhat if my partner went back to work and we put our baby in childcare? Childcare is not cheap, and working would need to bring in more than the cost of childcare. This requires a higher than average salary from a graduate job, (which is the life stage when people might reasonably start having children), so unless both parents are unusually high earners that option isnt viable either.\n\nLiving in London is only financially possible if you are either single or household income is more than £60k/year.\n\n[^1]: You'd be lucky to find a 1 bedroom flat for less than £1000/month\n[^2]: According to [Rightmove](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/house-prices/London.html), an estate agent with some useful price statistics.\n",

      "\n\nSince April I've been able to work full time as a solo founder. I've challenged\nmyself to build something useful enough that customers would want to pay for it\nand in the process of seeking that goal I've become a much better and more\nrounded developer.\n\nI've been working solo for about 7 months now, and in that time I've begun\nusing test driven development, I've built non-trivial data driven web apps\nusing Django, and I've learnt how to deploy and monitor those apps in\nproduction and make them performant.\n\nI've made two main apps; [moneybar.nl](https://moneybar.nl) and\n[pippip.email](https://pippip.email), and I've learnt so much.\n\nI'm realising though, that I still have much to learn in other spheres. Being a\ngreat developer is deeply meaningful to me. It's literally a bucket list item\nfor me and I intend to be writing code as long as I live. But there is no point\ncreating products if no one knows they exist.\n\nThis is where marketing and positioning comes in. Right now it feels like I\nknow nothing about how to get users, or validate an idea, or position a\nproduct. These are all super necessary and super unknown.\n\nOn a more meta level, I'm confronted with the lost benefits of working with\nco-founders, or of having friends doing similar things. I want to work faster\nand make progress more efficiently. I need to be part of a community.\n\nWorking in isolation does have its advantages, though. I'm self-taught and\nself-directed, figuring out the contours of uncharted territory and creating my\nown personal map. In my mind, I have a deep and almost personal relationship\nwith the coding abstractions and tools I've learnt to work with. Classes and\nfunctions, strings and floats, literally have (to me) their own textures,\ncolors and weights when I think or dream about them.\n\nIt feels like I can pick up these abstractions as if they were physical objects\nand turn them around to examine them. Place them next to each other and compare\nthe differences. Run thought experiements. In my experience, this kind of\nrelationship and affection simply doesn't happen when taking a class or\nfollowing someone elses schedule. It's satisying to feel ownership of a skill\nlike this, and it's one of the primary reasons I consider coding to be similar\nto a craft.\n\nHaving said all that, now that I realise I need to validate my product,\nposition it, and figure out marketing, I've stopped writing code, put down my\ntools, and I'm going to learn marketing. I've bought some books. Maybe I'll\npost some reviews here later.\n\nIn no particular order here is what I plan to read:\n\n- The 1-Page marketing plan, by Allan Dib Obviously Awesome, by April Dunford\n- Lean Analytics, Hooked, How to build habit-forming products, by Nir Eyal The\n- Mom Test, by Rob Fitzpatrick\n- This is marketing, by Seth Godin\n- Product-led growth, by Wes Bush\n\nI don't know if I've covered 90% of the distance required or 50%. It's\nexhausting but I'm here for the journey not the destination.\n",

    content:
      "\n\nThe rules[ref]or policies[/ref] and mental models that helped me\nsucceed in one season or phase of life may not be the best for the next phase.\n\nHere is a list of a few mental models I remember being concious of in previous\nyears. Probably I've already forgotten some.\n\n1.  _Always ask \"why...\"_. Be obsessive about this. It's going to make things\n    harder for a while before things get easier. You'll find difficult answers\n    that you otherwise wouldn't. If you're only concerned with the present then\n    its true that ignorance is bliss, but otherwise it's a liability.\n\n2.  _\"What if...\"_ is another good question to ask a lot.\n\n3.  _Adapt_ to the situation, don't make it adapt to you if you have any\n    choice. Be kind of like water, going around things and through the gaps.\n    Look for the edges and the gaps, the parts that aren't well known.\n\n4.  _Let people talk_ as much as they want to. Shut up and listen. If they\n    mean you harm or don't respect you then it'll become more obvious the more\n    they keep talking. If they mean you well or they're saying something\n    useful, you will benefit more from letting them talk more.\n\n5.  _Inversion_ - it can be hard to know if you should do something, but how\n    would you feel if you didn't do it, or if it didn't happen?\n\n6.  _Regrets are inevitable_, everyone has them. Same as making mistakes. Let\n    your regrets be for things that you did do, and not what you didn't do.\n\n7.  If you are willing to try something, fail at it, and still be glad that you\n    tried, then you should almost definitely do it. Commit to it and enjoy the\n    experience! Don't be scared, or at least, be scared _and_ optimistic and\n    happy[ref]Courage isn't the absence of fear. It's being scared and doing\n    the right thing anyway.[/ref].\n\n8.  There is beauty and luxury in being in such a bad spot that you are backed\n    into a corner with seemingly no way out. Things become black and white,\n    instead of shades of gray, and that will make priorities and options much\n    clearer. You are likely to work very efficiently and effectively in this\n    scenario, and you will learn important things about yourself.\n\n    Now that I'm older and I have responsibilities, I can't ever let things\n    become so bad that a situation becomes black and white. I have to\n    navigate a world of grays. If they do become black and white, I'll\n    already have a long list of failings.\n\n    When I was younger, things were more fragile. My resources were smaller and\n    things could quickly flip from good to bad. Enjoy the few benefits that a\n    situation like that gives, because (hopefully) once its gone its gone for\n    good.\n\n9.  The best way to solve a problem is to prevent it from occurring in the first\n    place. Succeeding at this will bring its own challenges.\n\n10. Take responsibility for things you are not responsible for, kind of. Do it\n    deliberately and for your own benefit, but don't forget that you are only\n    pretending that it's your responsibility.\n\n    If you do this, you will force yourself to understand a situation more\n    deeply and from other peoples perspectives. This will let you learn faster\n    and help you in future. Keep this at arms length though - it's make-believe\n    and you need to be able to switch it on and off. It's a toy for you to play\n    with. This seems to be what \"extreme responsibility\" is.\n\nI think its important to have mental models that you're comfortable with,\nbecause it lets you make decisions quickly and consistently. But understand\nthat [the map is not the\nterritory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/), and these are just\ntools in a toolbox.\n",

Avoid bad data.\n3. Keep it casual.\n4. Push for commitment and advancement.\n5. Frame the meeting well.\n6. Focus on the right, tight, customer segment.\n7. Prep well, take good notes, review your notes.\n\n## Update 2\n\nDoing Mom-test and customer development remotely:\n\n<IframeEmbed src='https://youtube.com/embed/bcWqxq2fJgY' />\n\n## Update 1\n\nThis [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28669410) on Hacker News\nmentions a similar book \"The Right It\" by Alberto Savoia. He mentions 8 ways to\ntest an idea:\n\n1.  The Pretend-to-Own – Before investing in buying whatever you need for your it, rent or borrow it first.\n1.  The Pinocchio – Build a non-functional, “lifeless”, version of the product.\n1.  The Fake Door – Create a fake “entry” for a product that doesn't yet exist in any form\n1.  The Minimum Viable Product (or Stripped Tease) – Create a functional version of it, but stripped down to its most basic functionality.\n1.  The Mechanical Turk – Replace complex and expensive computers or machines with human beings.\n1.  The Provincial – Before launching world-wide, run a test on a very small sample.\n1.  The Re-label – Put a different label on an existing product that looks like the product you want to create.\n\nRob Fitzpatrick responds to this comment with more thoughts and links to this [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28669204).\n\n## Chapter 1 - Opinions are worthless\n\n**Anything involving the future is an overly optimistic lie.**\nYou want objective facts about what happened in the past.\n\n1. Find out if people care about your idea by never mentioning it.\n2. Forcing yourself not to mention your idea will force you to ask better\n   questions\n3. Make sure your questions pass the mom test:\n   - Talk about their lives, not your idea.\n   - Ask about specific objective events in the past, not hypothetical scenarios.\n   - Spend most of your time listening, not talking.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Avoid bad data\n\n- You aren't allowed to tell them what their problem is.\n- They aren't allowed to tell you what to build.\n\nBad data includes:\n\n1. Compliments\n2. Fluff\n3. Hypotheticals\n4. Ideas\n\n## Chapter 3 - Ask the important questions\n\nYou should be terrified of at least one of the questions you ask in each conversation.\n\n1. Search out the scary questions you've been unintentionally avoiding. What's the worst thing a prospect could say? What's the scariest question you could ask?\n2. A good way to find scary questions is to imagine that your company has failed and then to ask why.\n3. If you get an unexpected answer to one of your questions and it doesn't have any effect on what you're going to do, then was it really worth asking it?\n4. General advice for hard things includes asking hard questions. Imagine you were delegating the task, what would you tell the person to do? That's you.\n5. You can ask about money.\n6. Love bad news - if you find out that your idea is fundamentally flawed you've just saved a tonne of time and energy and money. Move on. It's getting you closer to the truth.\n7. Bad news isn't the result of an opinion. No one knows if your idea will work, only the market knows.\n8. Opinions don't count.\n9. A lukewarm response to your idea can be a great conversation, because you realise that your idea isn't a great idea. Lukewarm means they don't care enough to buy the first (worst) version before it's ready.\n10. Look before you zoom. Don't focus on details too soon, you need to understand the big picture first.\n11. You have **product risk** and **customer risk**: 11. **Product risk** - can I build it and grow it? 12. **Customer risk** - is there a big enough group of people who are going to buy it?\n12. Pre-plan a list of the 3 most important questions (including a scary one) before every meeting or conversation. Be ready with these. They should change from week to week. As you get good quality answers to existing questions you can bring in new questions.\n\n## Chapter 4 - Keep it casual\n\n** Problem -> Solution -> Sales **\n\n1. Normally you would have 3 meetings with a client when you make a big sale. This lets you do each stage really well without blurring the data:\n   1. Identify your prospect's problem\n   2. Explain your solution\n   3. Sell the solution\n2. Identifying a problem doesn't have to be a meeting, keep it casual and you will get more honest feedback much faster. It works better as a chat when people are relaxed and saying what they really think.\n3. It take 5 minutes (max) to identify if a problem exists and is important.\n\n**Give as little info as possible about your idea whilst still nudging the conversation along**\n\n## Chapter 5 - The currencies of conversation\n\n**In early stage sales, the main goal is learning. Money is a side-effect.**\n\nWill they spend **money**, **time**, or **reputation** on your solution?\n\n1. If someone is willing to risk reputation, or spend time or money on your idea, then you can believe that they're interested.\n2. Hearing a compliment means they're trying to get rid of you.\n3. If it's a bad meeting or you're not sure what they really think, push for a commitment of some kind. Ask them to spend time, reputation or money and you'll see what they really think.\n4. If they aren't excited (not just interested, but in pain and excited for your solution) then you need to find that out ASAP. It's still a good meeting if you can discover this.\n5. Are you offering pain relief medication?\n6. A lead isn't a real lead until you've given them a concrete chance to reject you.\n7. Ask learning questions by using the Mom Test, then confirm by selling it.\n8. You need **crazy customers**:\n   1. They have a painful and expensive problem\n   2. They know they have a painful and expensive problem\n   3. They have the money to pay you to solve it\n   4. They already have their own bad solution to this terrible problem, and\n      yours is clearly better\n9. A crazy customer doesn't say \"yeah that's great, I'm really interested, let me know when its ready\". They say \"AHHH THIS IS THE WORST PART OF MY LIFE AND I WILL PAY YOU RIGHT NOW TO FIX IT!\"\n10. A crazy customer will front you the money when all you have is a barely functional prototype made of duct-tape\n11. A crazy customer is the person reading you blog, searching for workarounds, when you haven't spent loads of marketing and lead generation\n12. Keep a crazy customer close - they'll stick with you when times are tough.\n\n## Chapter 6 - Finding good conversations\n\n**Vision -> Framing -> Weakness -> Pedestal -> Ask**\n\nKeep having conversations until you stop hearing new stuff.\n\n1. **If it's a topic you both care about, find an excuse. You'll both enjoy the chat. You don't need to mention your idea if it breaks the premise.**\n2. Warm introductions are the ideal way to start a new conversation. 6 degrees of freedom in the world, so find someone who knows someone who knows them.\n3. Cold calls - LinkedIn, maybe.\n4. Serendipity - be prepared, be bold.\n5. Have a good excuse - hustle.\n6. Landing pages - so that googling the problems brings them to you.\n7. Organise an event - bring the businesses together for an event. You'll be considered an expert because you're facilitating it.\n8. Become a subject matter expert\n9. Speaking and teaching engagements - you get to have strong opinions, and you'll be respected.\n\n## Chapter 7 - Choosing you customers\n\n1. Startups don't starve, they drown. In options, choices, ideas. You get overwhelmed.\n2. Choose a good customer segment, focus on it, and don't get distracted.\n3. In the beginning:\n   1. Google - PhD students.\n   2. PayPal - eBay.\n   3. Evernote - Moms with recipes.\n4. It will look obvious with hindsight, probably not so obvious before you've figured it out.\n5. If you can't get a consistent answer to a question, maybe you're speaking to different segments.\n6. If you aren't finding **consistent problems and goals** then you don't have a specific enough customer segment. 7. Within the group, which type of person would want it the most? 8. Would everyone within the group want to buy/use it? Or only some? 9. Why does the subset want it? 10. Does everyone in the group have the same motivation? 11. What other motivations are there? 12. Who else (outside the group) has these motivations?\n7. Go for **Who-Where** pairs of segments. \"Finance professionals who run marathons\"..\n8. You want customers who are reachable, profitable, and personally rewarding.\n\n**Good segments are usually \"who-where\" pairs. If you don't know where to find your customers, keep slicing until you do. Make sure the segment is reachable, profitable, and personally rewarding**\n\n## Chapter 8 - Getting the most from the conversations by prepping and reviewing\n\n1. Prepare well 2. Have your **three big questions** ready, including the scary ones. 3. Know who you are speaking to. 4. Know what commitment and next-steps you want to push for. 5. Spend up to an hour writing down: 1. **Your best guesses about what you think they'll say.** 2. **What they care about.** 3. **What they want.**\n\n   - If you have a focussed segment, you'll only need to do this occasionally.\n   - If you come across a question which can be answered using the internet, use the internet.\n\n2. Take good notes 4. Ask if you can record the audio. 6. Record emotions as well as words. Verbatim alone isn't always accurate 6 months later. 5. Use shorthand for follow up. 5. Observe and record emotions - happy, angry, meh, etc. 6. Pains and obstacles are a lot more important if someone is embarrassed or angry when they're talking about them. 7. Dig into the big emotions, find out what's causing them, or why its a big deal.\n3. Review your notes 8. Meta - which questions went well or not? 9. What were the answers to the scary questions? 10. How can you do better next time? 11. What were the clear signals? What signals did you miss?\n",

The list is a datastructure.\n- A changelist is local to its buffer.\n\n### Registers\n\n- `0` contains the content of the last yank\n- `1`-`9` contains the content you've deleted or changed\n\n- `_` blackhole register - send something here and it wont change any other register.\n- `-` contains any deleted or changed content smaller than 1 row.\n- `%` contains the name of the current file.\n\n### Expression register\n\n1. In insert mode, `<C-r>=`.\n2. Type any valid vimscript.\n3. The output is inserted into the buffer.\n\n### Substitutions\n\n- `:&&` → repeat the last substitution command with its flags\n- `:~` → repeat the lat substitution with the same replacement, but with the last used search pattern\n\n### Command line\n\n- `q:` - opens the command line window.

      "\n\n# Ambition\n\nSince I was 15, one of my ambitions has been to be an entrepreneur. I used to joke with my dad about buying him a nice boat one day.\n\nLife so far has been predominantly about education, and that stage is over now. I’m walking away from what I've come to see as a lifestyle and career that has too many contradictions, it doesn't make sense to live like this. Ultimately I want to develop multiple sources of passive income. I want to create.\n\n## Summer 2017\n\nThe last few months have been intense, with some weeks leaving me feeling ambitious and energetic, and others feeling anxious and overwhelmed. I need to get better at defining a goal, taking the quickest path there, and ignoring interesting distractions.\n\nRitsya is brave enough and imaginative enough to force me to think big and consider how to live a better life. My biggest fear is that I screw it up, shooting myself in the foot and Ritsya and my daughter also. We were headed safely to an unremarkable existence and it would be terrible to swap that for something worse. That won't happen.\n\nI know that I make better decisions and produce my best work under pressure, I thrive when I'm perceived as an underdog. I need to accept this without using it as a reason to be foolish. Whilst I don’t have a clear plan, or direction, or goal, (I have many of them) I’ve got skills and I want to see what I can make. I’ll never do my best work, using my most productive combination of skills and experiences, if I’m a cog in someone else's machine.\n\nIt’s safer being an employee than self-employed. I guess the price of removing self-employment risks is the difference between the value you generate for your employer and what you’re paid. I think those risks are overpriced, and most people are more capable than they realise. Sometimes you have to walk into a situation to find out how to make the most of it. And sometimes you have to leave a place in order to gain perspective.\n\n## Autumn 2016\n\nLast year my boss gave me some advice that was supposed to be encouraging. I’d requested to reduce my involvement with some stuff that was unrelated to my job so that I could contribute more to my team and still maintain some semblance of a work/life balance.\n\nMy boss was pretty clear that reducing my involvement in the extra stuff would not be possible. During our conversation he advised me not to worry about how much I contributed to the team because “the work will get done anyway”. This was meant to be encouraging, but instead removed any conviction that the work I did was important.\n",

Try to be happy, optimistic and relaxed. What are you working so hard for\n   anyway? You need something to do, someone to love, something to hope for.\n\n# Longevity Calculations\n\nI was playing with the life expectancy calculator at [blueprintincome](https://www.blueprintincome.com/tools/life-expectancy-calculator-how-long-will-i-live/)[ref]There is also a more detailed\ncalculator at [projectbiglife](https://www.projectbiglife.ca/life-expectancy-calculator), its calibrated for Canadian citizens.[/ref] and was surprised to find that their regression technique gives me\na 50% chance of living to 95! I'd expected a result closer to 80.\n\nAfter printing out a [90 year calendar](/documents/90-year-life-calendar.jpg), my next\nthought was to play with the calculator to find the maximum age I could have a 50% chance of reaching.\n\nDoing the factors below would apparently give me:\n\n- 75% chance of living to 92\n- 50% change of living to 101\n- 25% chance of living to 107\n\n## Don't workout every day\n\nThere is no additional benefit from working out more than 4 times a week.\nOnce you're fit and working out 4 times a week it doesn't matter if you do\nmore exercise.\n\nBeing in \"excellent\" health is better than being in \"very good\" health though,\nso make the workouts count. I guess if it didn't make a difference then it\nwouldn't be excellent in the first place.\n\n## Drink more alcohol\n\nI was surprised that having 3-4 drinks each week increases your life\nexpectancy. I thought that it was best to not drink any alcohol at all.\n\nI should be drinking red wine or liquor 3 or 4 times each week. Liquor increases\nlongevity in men, but reduces longevity for women. Red wine increases longevity in\nwomen, but has no effect in men[ref][alcohol consumption in later life and reaching longevity: the netherlands cohort study ](https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/49/3/395/5730334)[/ref]. I guess I\nshould drink some rum after each workout.\n\n## Weight doesn't make a different\n\nAccording to their regression, my expected longevity is unchanged within a\nweight range of 78kg - 90kg. I guess it's much more important that I'm in\n\"excellent\" health, working out 4 times a week and having some wine, rum, or\nwhiskey after each workout.\n\n# But it's just statistics\n\nThe calculator only asks for quantifiable or physical attributes. It doesn't\nconsider emotional, relational or spiritual factors.\n",

      '\n\nA useful model I\'ve come across states that it takes three generations for a\nsociety to deny something previously considered true. The first generation\nstudies or experiences something which leads to a particular value or belief.\nThe second generation inherits the belief and assumes it to be true, but\ndoesn\'t arrive at the belief through their own critical thought. The third\ngeneration then questions the assumption, realises that most holders of the\nbelief do not have a good basis for their belief, and disregards it.\n\nThe belief that people have a responsibility to look after each other and treat\neach other with a minimum level of respect seems to be following this route.\n\nThat humans inherently deserve a degree of respect and dignity simply because\nthey are human is self-evident. In times of comfort and excess it could be\nignored, but in times of calamity and in the aftermath of disasters it becomes\nundeniable and obvious. This is partly because disasters reveal our instinct\nfor justice and our frailty in the face of misfortune.\n\nLife is experienced through the lens of the mind, and its perception is mostly\ngoverned by fundamental circumstances or desires. The trappings of a prosperous\nsociety allows this reality to be covered by a veneer of soft arguments, or\nrejected in favor of a viewpoint that says we have superseded these supposedly\nbasic origins.\n\nGood leaders should know better. They should study history and be self-aware.\nIn the past they have forgotten this reality and have been forced to relearn it\nat great cost. Are we about to forget, again, and let our children live with\nthose consequences?\n\nMy grandfathers generation saw the damage that sectarian systems bring, and\nwere forced to answer questions around how much respect people deserve only\nbecause they are people. As the consequences of different views and systems\nbecame evident, my fathers generation assumed the answers to be self-evident,\nbecause the consequences of the previous "forgetting" were still clear.\n\nWho is clearly articulating this now? This year?\n\nWhen we discuss taxation, social mobility, migration, military intervention,\nwhy do we not start with the assumed self-evident truth that people are\ninherently valuable and important? Humans are more than metrics, and cannot be\nentirely evaluated using only quantitative methods.\n\nHorton, the title character in "Horton Hears a Who" by Dr. Zeus, understood\nthis. He went to great lengths to protect the tiny and weak people in\nwho-ville. We teach this truth to our children, but do not demonstrate it as\nadults. Jesus also understood it. He said that we should love our neighbours,\nand explained that our neighbours are people we come across who need our help.\n\nI wonder if forgetting that humans are inherently worthy of respect is a\nprerequisite for declining;\n\n- standards of governance\n- social mobility\n- peace\n- economic growth\n\nWhich makes me think it is a self defeating deception. When we choose to\ndisregard a group of humans because it is inconvenient to help them, we are\nelevating our needs above theirs. This seems to create chains of events where\neverybody suffers.\n',

      "\n\n# Stop stuff stopping\n\nIf you run a command in a terminal session and the terminal session is\ndisconnected, then the processes running in it will also be terminated.\n\nI discovered this when I was trying to download a ~500GB database\novernight. I logged in the next morning expecting to see a completed download, but\nfound I only had half the file.\n\n# Use `nohup` to ignore `HUP` signals\n\nOne solution to this seems to be to use `nohup`, a command that\nignores the `HUP` signal. It stops your programme from stopping if the terminal\nsession its running in is stopped.\n\nBy convention, the `HUP` signal is the method used by a terminal to warn\ndependent processes that it is about to logout.\n\nYou probably want to run `nohup` in the background. You might want to prevent\nit from creating `nohup.out`.\n\n# Close or redirect fd0 - fd2\n\nOn Linux, `nohup` automatically closes `stdin`. If you're using MacOS or BSD\nthis doesn't automatically happen, so you might want to redirect it yourself.\nThis is because if a background process tries to read anything from `stdin`\nthen it will pause itself whilst it waits for you to bring it to the foreground\nand type some input. This is probably a waste of time.\n\nIf `nohup` detects that you have redirected `stdout` and `stderr` then it won't\ncreate `nohup.out`.\n\nAs with all commands, if you put `&` at the end of the command, it will run in\nthe background. You can bring it to the foreground by running `fg`, or see a\nlist of jobs by running `jobs`.\n\nIf you redirect input to /dev/null (`</dev/null`) you will stop the program\nfrom receiving keyboard (stdin) input, but you won't prevent it from accessing\nthe terminal directly. Also you haven't removed the program from the shell's\nprocess group.\n\n# Stopping signals using `disown`\n\nIf you want to remove a program from the shell's process group, then\nimmediately after you've run the command to start your programme, run `disown`\nwith no arguments. This will make the background process no longer associated\nwith the shell job and it wont have any signals forwarded to it by the shell.\n\nA `disown`ed process gets nothing (no signals) sent to it by the shell. But\nwithout a `nohup` it will still be sent a `HUP` signal sent via other means,\nsuch as a manual `kill` command.\n\nA `nohup`ed process will ignore any and all `HUP` signal, no matter how they\nare sent.\n\n[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10408816/how-do-i-use-the-nohup-command-without-getting-nohup-out)\n\n# Related\n\n## `w` is a combination of `who`, `uptime`, and `ps -a`.\n\nUse `w` to see who is logged in and what they are doing. It summarises who is\nlogged in, what they are currently doing, and the load of the current\nactivities.\n\n## Process Groups\n\nA collection of one or more processes. It's used to control the distribution of\na signal. When a signal is directed to a process group, the signal is delivered\nto each process that is a member of the group.\n\n## Sessions\n\nA collection of one or more process groups. A process may not create a process\ngroup that belongs to another session. A process is not permitted\nto join a process group that is a member of another session. A process\nis not permitted to migrate from one session to another.\n",

'**This person is either drunk or stupid**' - feedback on one of his papers that went on to become significant\n\n4.  For creative researchers; read a bit of the literature and notice something that you think everybody is doing wrong. (I guess GH is contrarian in this sense)\n\n5.  Look for a problem that doesn't feel _right_. Then figure out how to do it right.\n\n6.  When people tell you that your (contrarian) approach is just no good, just keep at it.\n\n7.  Either your intuitions are good or they're not. If they are good then you should follow them and you will eventually be successful. If they are bad then it doesn't matter what you do.\n\n8.  You might as well trust your intuitions.\n\n9.  When you try to replicate a published paper you discover all the little tricks needed to make it work.\n\n10. Never stop programming.\n\n11. If you give a student something to do and they are a bad student then they'll come back and say it didn't work. They'll say this because of some little decision they made which they didn't realise was crucial. But if you give it to a good student, you can give them anything and they will come back and say it works\n\n12. Read enough so that you start developing intuitions, and then trust your intuitions and go for it! - Don't be too worried if everybody else says its nonsense.\n\n13. If you think it's a really good idea, and others tell you its complete nonsense, then you know you are really onto something!\n\n    One example of this is when Ramford and I first came up with variational methods, I sent a mail explaining it to a former student, who showed it to his colleagues. He told me that they said 'Either this guy is drunk or he is just stupid'. They really really thought is was nonsense.\n\n    Maybe that is partly because of how i explained it - I explained it in intuitive terms, but when you have what you think is a good idea and other people think it is complete rubbish, that is the sign of a really good idea.\n\n14. See if you can find an advisor who has beliefs similar to your own, because if you work on stuff that your adviser feels deeply about, then you'll get a lot of good advice and time from them.\n\n15.

      '\n\n### Intro\n\n1. In order to do better marketing, understand your value and differentiators\n   better\n2. Understand what makes a best-fit customer\n3. Positioning is a fundamental input to every business tactic you use\n4. If you fail at positioning, you fail at marketing and sales\n5. Positioning is "conext setting" for products\n6. Customers need to be able to easily understand\n   1. What your product does\n   2. Why it is special\n   3. Why it matters to them\n7. If your prospects can\'t figure out what your product does quickly, they will\n   invent a position for you. It might hide your key strengths or misunderstand\n   your value.\n8. Find people to demo your product to, then ask them to describe it back to\n   you. Do the same with existing customers. If they\'re not saying the same\n   thing then you have a positioning problem.\n9. Products with strong positioning:\n   1. Find the best kind of customer\n   2. Make the value obvious\n   3. Sell quickly\n\n## Part 1\n\n### Positioning as context\n\n1. Without positioning to guide us, we don\'t know how to understnad a product\n2. Positioning lets us make assumptions about\n   1. who a product is for\n   2. what its main features are\n   3. how much it costs\n3. Without it we would be paralyzed by choice, and we wouldnt be able to make\n   sense of all the products around us.\n4. The context and purpose of a product from the founders/engineers perspective\n   are often different to those of the prospect\n5. Products can be positioned in multiple ways, and often the best positioning\n   is not the default positioning\n6. Bad positioning makes it harder for prospects to figure out if your product\n   is worth thinking about.\n7. Positioning requires considering:\n   1. Customers point of view - what problem/pain does it solve\n   2. The ways your product is uniquely different\n   3. The characteristics of a potential customer\n   4. The best market context to make your value uniquely obvious\n\n### Five (plus one) components of effective positioning\n\n1. **Competitive Alternatives - if you didn\'t exist, what would your customers\n   use instead?**\n   1. Its what your prospects would use to do the task if your product didn\'t\n      exist. It could be excel, or pen and paper. It could be nothing, (in\n      which case maybe you product doesn\'t solve a real pain point.)\n   2. You probably know a lot more about your market, and problem, and\n      alternative solutions, than your prospects do. ("Doing nothing" could be\n      an opportunity, not a red flag.)\n   3. Its important to understand what customers will compare your product\n      with, because this is how they will define "better". Is it "easier" than\n      a pen and paper?\n   4. Customers might never have purchased a solution like yours before.\n2. **Unique Attributes - What do you have that alternative do not?**\n   1. Could be:\n      1. Delivery Model (online vs offline, installed on-site vs not)\n      2. Business model (rental vs purchase)\n      3. Specific expertise (data scientist with financial and back-end web\n         dev expertise)\n3. **Value (and quantifiable objective proof) - What value do the attributes\n   enable for customers?**\n   1. If unique attributes are your secret sauce, the value is why someone\n      might care about your secret sauce\n   2. Fact based, provable, demonstrable, quantifiable, objective. Third party\n      opinions are relevant.\n4. **Target market characteristics - Who cares a lot about that value?**\n   1. Focus on customers who are most likely to purchase quickly, wont ask for\n      discounts, will tell their friends about you.\n   2. You should clearly identify who these are and\n   3. Identity what sets them apart from other groups of customers. Why are\n      they uniquely likely to buy from you when others wouldnt or would take\n      longer to consider and make a purchase\n5. **Market Category - What context makes your value obvious to the ideal\n   customer?**\n   1. Declaring that your product exists in a certain market triggers a\n      powerful set of assumptions\n   2. make these assumptions help you, not hinder you.\n   3. When presented with your product, customers will try to use what they\n      already know to figure out what your product is all about and why its\n      special. You want them to be able to do this really quickly and easily.\n   4. Make these assumptions work for you, not against you. You won\'t have to\n      list every feature, because most of them will be assumed by the context\n      of the market category.\n   5. Get it right, and sales efforts (copy) wont be wasted battling those\n      assumptions, but can instead build off of them to show secret sauce and\n      value more obviously.\n6. **(Bonus) Relevant Trends - what trends make your product relevant right\n   now?**\n   1. Used carefully, trends can show prospoects why they should pay attention\n      to your product right now. Increases urgency.\n   2. It can increase urgency, excitement, coolness, credibility\n   3. but the trend must be directly relevant, practically and objectively\n      applicable.\n   4. Blockchains, AI, ML are trends - they are relevant to multiple markets.\n\nEach of these components is relevant to the others\n',

      "\n\n## The problem\n\nIn many countries the ability to create legally binding agreements is not available to average citizens. Legal services are often unaffordable and opaque, or service providers are corrupt. Legal services are in need of disruption.\n\n## The solution\n\n### Pangea\n\nBitnation (who I consult for) intends to address this problem by empowering people to self-organise and self-govern. We are building a platform called Pangea which allows users to create, notarise and arbitrate contracts according to a jurisdiction which each party joins voluntarily, irrespective of their geographical location.\n\nPangea is a smart phone app that looks and feels like a chat app, the back-end (called Panthalassa) is an encrypted mesh network hooked up to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n### Rewarded for doing good, empowered to be a responsible citizen\n\nOn Pangea, people are incentivised to be good citizens by receiving rewards for doing good, rather than being coerced by the threat of punishment for bad behaviour.\n\nThis platform would fulfil a vast and unmet need, particularly in countries whose legal systems function poorly. On Pangea, a user voluntarily chooses which jurisdiction to be a part of. Contracts are then notarised, executed and arbitrated according to that jurisdiction. Users voluntarily join a decentralised borderless voluntary nation (DBVN) and will receive tokens (Pangea Arbitration Tokens) as a reward for good behaviour. The tokens will be tradable and will be used as payment on Pangea for notarisation and arbitration services.\n\n### Combining a store of value and access to legal services\n\nSocieties cannot escape their need to use currency as stores of value. They also cannot escape their need to create reliable and enforceable agreements (contracts) with each other.\n\nGenerating Bitcoin through proof of work occurs because individuals believe that Bitcoin will be continuously used — that it will meet an ongoing need to transact using a decentralised and disintermediated method.\n\nGenerating PAT by being a good citizen will occur because individuals believe that Pangea will be continuously used — that it will meet an ongoing need to create enforceable agreements using a voluntary and geographically agnostic (and decentralised) method.\n\n### Comments\n\nThere is much still to say about the Pangea platform and the mechanisms which will make it function. Please give feedback and ask questions in the comments. To find out more, visit the [website](http://bitnation.co).\n",

      "\n\nWhen I began blogging in 2016, I became more aware of how blogs are designed. Many of my favorting blogs had simple designs which made it easier to focus on the content, and they loaded really fast. (E.g. [unwiredcouch.com](https://unwiredcouch.com) and [CuriousGnu](https://www.curiousgnu.com)). I wanted this for my blog, too. I'd used Wordpress to build and publish my blog which was a great way to begin, but I felt I was compromising on its design and functionality. I wanted to have control over my blog's features.\n\nThis led me to static sites which contain only fixed content and are faster to load and easier to design than one built using a dynamic blogging platform such as Wordpress. Because I was already familiar with Python I chose [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) rather than another static site generator such as Jekyll.\n\nThere are plenty of sites to tell you how to start blogging in Pelican, so here I will focus on my experience after the initial set-up. When I was learning how to begin, I found [Amy Hanlons](http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html) blog particularly useful and clear.\n\n## The learning curve\n\n… was longer than I expected. Since setting out to switch from Wordpress to Pelican, I've taught myself enough of the following tools to hack this site together. I'm really happy about this because these tools could be used in future projects too.\n\n### HTML\n\nI find HTML quirky but intuitive. Tags make sense, comments are laborious and learning by google is relatively quick. Whatever it is I'm trying to do (like add a link to jump back to the top of the page) someone will have posted the answer somewhere.\n\n### CSS\n\nWriting CSS feels a lot more concise that HTML but it also felt impossible to learn without taking a step back and reading an introductory course. Usually I learn by hacking new phrases together from existing examples so it was frustrating to go backwards before progressing. There was a lightbulb moment when I realised CSS Selectors were a thing, and realising CSS files get called in the header (usually) of an HTML file…\n\nI ended up using a trial subscription to [Thinkfuls](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/) Front-end developer course, which is pretty good at explaining how CSS is structured and how to arrange content on a page. If I still had access, I'd be completing the second half of the course :)\n\n### Jinja templates\n\nJinja is a tool written in Python to create HTML pages. It doesn't look intuitive to me, but I've been able to get enough done by copy-pasting similar snippets from other parts of the theme I started with ([Thanks Molivier!](https://github.com/molivier/nest)) to make the changes I wanted. I'd like to learn more as it seems really powerful.\n\n### Pelican\n\nTo build a website using Pelican, you need to run commands from the terminal. There are various commands but I found myself using only a few regularly. \"Pelican-quickstart\" will generate a project skeleton to get you started. \"make devserver\" will initialise a local server and generate output files so that I can view changes locally before uploading (its opposite is \"make stopserver\"). Finally \"pelican content -s publishconf.py\" generates the html and css for remote hosting. Some of the plugins I use such as \"Assets\" which minifies the CSS only work when publshconf.py is called, which confused me initially as I didn't think it was working when I was only using \"make devserver\".\n\n### Git\n\nThis really challenged me, and I still don't feel like I know what I'm doing. Git is far more powerful than I need it to be, when all I want to do is undo some erroneous edits and upload a new version of the site to Github.\n\nI can stage and commit files, I can create local and remote repo's from the command line. I can change a remote's URL, reset a repo and force a push or a pull. That's all. I haven't tried to merge or to create a test branch, and if some part of the process goes wrong it usually takes hours to make it right again.\n\nThis is one tool for which the awesome SO and Google cannot magic up the exact right answer immediatly, unfortunately.\n\nFor example, there is still an output folder in the source repo that is… mysterious to me. Its not the real output, its a version frozen in time from a few weeks ago, and it has an \"@\" in its name. I don't know how it got there. It was created one afternoon in a blur of frustrated google queries and copy/paste/hope terminal commands.\n\nI find git's commands the least intuitive of all the tools I use, with its preceeding single dashes and double dashes, and random words thrown into the middle of otherwise reasonable commands.\n\nBut Git is ubiquitous and Github is awesome, so I will learn it.\n\n## Github pages with an external URL\n\nYou'll need to add a file called CNAME to the repo containing the output. CNAME should contain the address of your site in lowercase. Simple.\n\nYou'll also need to update the DNS records of your domain name to point the name at Github's servers. For Github, you need two \"A Records\" with host type \"@\" and values \"192.30.252.153\" and \"192.30.252.154\" respectively. You also need a CNAME record with host type \"www\" and the value equal to \"username.github.io\". It took about 12 hours for the changes to propagate, and during that time I had variable success loading the site.\n\n## Plugins\n\nOne thing I didn't want when moving away from Wordpress was a site bloated with features that didn't make the content easier to read. However I found I still needed a few plugins to optimise my site and provide some basic functionality that doesn't come with the vanilla Pelican.\n\n### iPython notebooks\n\nSuper useful, as all I need to do to publish a notebook as a webpage is copy the .ipynb file into the context directory and add a sidecar .ipynb-meta file with standard meta data. This functionality is one of the main reasons why Pelican is popular with data bloggers. (Though [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) is another option).\n\n### Neighbors\n\nAt the end of a post there should be a link to the previous and next blog posts - I was surprised this wasn't included as standard. After putting the plugin in the plugins folder and updating pelicanconf.py, you need to copy a couple of jinja snippets into a template, and maybe add some css to make the links look nice.\n\n### Optimise images\n\nMake those images as small as possible to help make the site as fast as possible. Add the plugin, update pelicanconf.py, and thats all.\n\n### Assets\n\nBefore I started working with Pelican, minifying css and JavaScript would have been too advanced. But once [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/) and Google [Pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) started criticising me for my multiple .css files, I accepted the challenge.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI'm super happy wth the websites design and speed. It's designed the way I want it, and I've learnt a ton of useful stuff along the way.\n\nUpdate: My second post about blogging in Pelican is [here](pelican_2).\n",

      "\n\n## Design\n\nMy approach to building my blog is to keep it as simple as possible, only adding features when they make a significant improvement to how the content is understood and used. Therefore I've done away with several features that would normally come baked into a WordPress theme. For example a footer full of links that would never be used, and a sidebar full of distractions.\n\nI opted for a single column design that hopefully presents text-heavy articles clearly and intuitively (please leave a comment and tell me what you think).\n\n## Plugins\n\nMy use of plugins to extend Pelican's functionality reflects this, there is the [Neighbors](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/neighbors) plugin so that the next or previous post can be accessed from the bottom of a post without going back to the index, and the [Tag Cloud](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/tag_cloud) plugin to reflect which subjects are written about the most (and provide a link to all relevant articles).\n\n## Speed\n\nThe speed of the site is important because a faster site is more enjoyable to use. Therefore I've minified the CSS and the JavaScript using the [Assets](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/assets) plugin. I've also set the CSS and JavaScript to load asynchronously. Images are optimised using the [Optimize Images](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/optimize_images) plugin so that their file size is as small as possible and they download quickly. The site uses CloudFlare's free CDN features so hopefully no matter when you view the site from you get a decent page speed.\n\n## Jinja templates\n\nI've also arranged the homepage so that posts are shown by their category and then by posting date. This may not work very well with a larger number of posts, but I'll only consider that problem once it presents itself. Designing for hypotheticals or conditions that don't yet exist is a waste of time.\n\nThere are examples of how I've used Jinja templates below in the context of sharing my articles on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n## Plugin: Share Post\n\nI noticed that my posts were beginning to get tweeted about, so I thought it would be useful to have some sharing buttons at the bottom of each post for Twitter, Facebook and Email. Looking at the Pelican Plugins repo on Github showed there was (as usual) a plugin for this (called [Share Post](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/share_post)), though I noted it hadn't been updated for a couple of years.\n\nInstalling and initial set-up was simple thanks to the readme on the git repo. You need to copy the plugin folder to the plugins directory, and add the name of the plugin to the list in pelicanconf.py. Then you need to copy paste some Jinja/HTML into the article.html template. That's enough to make it work.\n\nI noted though that when I shared to Twitter the text to be tweeted was encapsulated in quotes and there was a 'b' at the front. I realised this was due to using Python 3.x when the plugin (which hadn't been updated for 2 years) was likely written for Python 2.x. A quick google and the obligatory trip to SO showed me how to convert a bytes string to a normal text string.\n\n```python\n# Python 2\ntweet = ('%s%s' % (title, url)).encode('utf-8')\n\n# Python 3\ntweet_as_byte = ('%s%s' % (title, url)).encode('utf-8')\ntweet = str(tweet_as_byte,'utf-8')\n```\n\nI also found that an article couldn't be shared to twitter from a mobile device and this was due to the URL being incorrectly formatted. The new URL format required separate arguments for the URL, additional text and the twitter handle:\n\n```python\n# Incorrect\ntwitter_link = 'http://twitter.com/home?status=%s' % tweet\n\n# Correnct\ntwitter_link = 'http://twitter.com/share?url=%s&text=%s&via=%s' % (url, tweet, t_handle)\n```\n\n## Using meta-data to specify tweet text\n\nI thought it would be cool to add some default text to a tweet, as I've enjoyed this feature on other blogs when I've found a post I wanted to share on Twitter. - A user may know they want to share an article but if they're in a hurry it might be hard to find the right words, so why not provide a ready-made tweet. The text is editable so it's only a suggestion.\n\nThe text would be different for each post so it makes sense to specify it when writing the article. The article 'summary' would be too long, and I know that Pelican supports arbitrary meta-data tags. I assumed that Jinja would pick up the data the same way it picks up the 'standard' meta-data and added a function to share_post.py.\n\n```python\ndef article_tweet(content):\n    tweet = ''\n    if hasattr(content, 'tweet'):\n        tweet =  BeautifulSoup(content.tweet, 'html.parser').get_text().strip()\n        return quote(('%s' % (tweet)).strip().encode('utf-8'))\n    else:\n        return ' '\n```\n\nOnce this function was working it was simply a case of calling the function and assigning the output to a variable I called \"Tweet\", and then adding \"Tweet\" to the text string to be included in a tweets text:\n\n```python\n    tweet = article_tweet(content)\n    tweet_as_byte = ('%s' % (tweet)).encode('utf-8')\n    tweet = str(tweet_as_byte,'utf-8')\n    t_handle = twitter_handle(content)\n```\n\nThere was a bit of fiddling around to make sure that the number of spaces between each part of the tweet was correct, but nothing as complicated as when making [Time Until](time-until).\n\n## Specifying the text and image in a Facebook share\n\nSharing to Facebook worked without any formatting problems, but it bugged me that the opening text of the article was being used in the preview that was shared to Facebook when I had a summary already prepared and that would be much more useful to potential readers. For some articles I also had an article image that I wanted to see being used.\n\nGoogling revealed that I needed to use particular meta tags in the webpage's header if I wanted to control what Facebook would pickup. Facebook uses the \"open graph\" standards so I would need the headers in my article pages to include the following:\n\n```HTML\n`<!-- Open Graph data -->`\n`<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Title Here\" />`\n`<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" />`\n`<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"http://www.example.com/\" />`\n`<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"http://example.com/image.jpg\" />`\n`<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Description Here\" />\n```\n\nI could see that I already had some meta tags being generated using the Jinja templates so I set about copy-pasting and modifying them to build the new tags. I had some issues with trailing white space or line breaks being included within the content string. This was solved like so:\n\n```jinja2\n{# Adding '-' after and before the %'s strips white space and line breaks #}\n{% block description %}\n\t{%- if article.summary -%}\n\t\t{{ article.summary|striptags|truncate(200)|e }}\n\t{%- else -%}\n\t\t{{ article.content|striptags|truncate(200)|e }}\n\t{%- endif -%}\n{% endblock description %}\n```\n\nI also needed to use some blocks more than once, because a description tag was already included but Facebook wants an \"og:description\", and Twitter wants a \"Twitter:Description\" too. All three of these tags will include the same text (generated in the Jinja2 snippet above). If a block only needs to be used once then it's generated like this;\n\n```jinja2\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{% block description %}{% endblock description %}\">\n```\n\n```jinja2\n{% block description %}{% endblock description %}\n```\n\nIf you call the above more than once Jinja will throw you an error. The documentation (and SO) reveal that the solution is to use:\n\n```jinja2\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"{{ self.description() }}\">\n```\n\nThis allows you to reuse blocks multiple times and keep your templates tidy.\n\nFinally, when I was testing Facebook to see if the correct text or image was being picked up I was initially frustrated to see that the new tags were not having any effect. This is because Facebook crawls your site and saves what it finds. If you want it to take a fresh look at your page with its new meta tags, you need to tell Facebook to crawl the page again, using the [Facebook linter/debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/).\n\nYou can see the new sharing buttons below, please click them and see what happens!\n\nNote: My first article describing how I began to use Pelican is [here](pelican_blog)\n",

      "\n\nBuilding my own [web analytics](analytics) has\nbeen a gateway to learning more about Google Cloud Platform. So far I've used\nDataStore, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, Storage Buckets and Scheduler.\n\n## Version 1\n\nMy first version of the analytics tool took the following form:\n\n### Logger Function\n\n1.  When the browser navigates to a page on the site, a JavaScript beacon is\n    sent which triggers a cloud function.\n1.  The function parses the page URL and the IP address, and creates a record in\n    the database.\n\n### Aggregator Function\n\n1.  Each time the analytics page is loaded, a cloud function is triggered that\n    gets every record from DataStore, parses the data and returns a JSON object\n    containing the aggregated data.\n1.  The browser receives the JSON, parses it and creates some charts and\n    tables.\n\nThe good: It works, it was quick and simple to build.\n\nThe bad: Its expensive. Loading the analytics page is slow - when the DataStore\nwas small it took 3 or 4 seconds, after a few thousand page views it took about\n40 seconds.\n\nConclusion - keep the logger function as it is, but improve the aggregator\nfunction.\n\n## Version 2\n\nThe second version still used DataStore but was much more efficient. It didn't\nread the entire database and generate the aggregated results every time the analytics\npage was viewed.\n\nInstead, a cloud function periodically collected all the records in the\ndatastore database and calculated the results. The results were\nwritten to a JSON file and sent to a storage bucket.\n\nWhen the analytics page was loaded in a browser, the browser collects and\nprocesses the JSON file from the bucket. This is much faster, performant\nand cheaper than creating a new JSON object each time the analytics page is viewed.\n\nThe good: The analytics page loads at the same speed regardless of how much data\nhas been aggregated and how frequently the analytics page is being viewed.\nPerformance issues have been solved, though I still don't think DataStore is the\nbest database solution for this use case.\n\nThe bad: DataStore seems expensive - I am being charged for AppEngine\nservices (which I don't really understand but is caused by using\nDataStore). If I can get monthly costs down to about a cup of coffee (about\n€4/month or €0.15/day) then I don't mind running it indefinitely.\n\n## Version 3\n\nUse BigQuery instead of DataStore. BigQuery is a Data Warehouse that is\nwell suited for analytics. It is not well suited for transactional use cases -\nwhere data is being read, updated or created many times per second.\n\nThis is fine for my use case - the Page Logger function writes a record to a\nBigQuery table each time each time a page view is logged. During times of high traffic it's\npossible that concurrency issues might arise and some page views will be lost,\nbut this isn't an issue 99% of the time. My site traffic is very light. I believe I\ncould use a newer API that google recently released to solve this problem but\nfor now I'll use the normal API.\n\nThe rest of the process is unchanged - the aggregator function periodically\nreads the (BigQuery) database, crunches that data and sends a JSON file to a\nstorage bucket.\n\nThe good: This is completely free. The analytics page can be viewed quickly\nregardless of the amount of site traffic.\n\nThe bad: Under heavy traffic some page views might be lost due to a limit on how\nquickly new rows can be added to BigQuery tables. Using a new API might resolve\nthis.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### Totally free tools forever\n\nThe combination of Cloud Functions, Storage Buckets and Big Query (along with\nScheduler and Pub/Sub) seems really versatile and I think there are many\ninteresting things that could be done by combining these services[ref]The\nquestion then becomes: \"Just because you could do it, should you do it?\"[/ref] .\n\nUsing them all for free (my usage is well within the free tier) makes the\npossibilities even more interesting. Having compute and storage services\nrunning indefinitely in the cloud for free is amazing.\n\n[Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#free-tier-usage-limits)\n\n### Aggregate by calendar month\n\nAn improvement to this analytics setup would be creating aggregated metrics for\neach calendar month and storing them in separate JSON files. This would prevent\ndata older than one month being processed repeatedly, and create a cap on the\namount of computational effort required (the maximum amount of data processed\nby one cloud function instance would become capped at one month).\n\nIf the browser wanted to display more than one month of data, it would simply\nrequest more than one JSON file from the storage bucket.\n\n### TODO\n\n- [x] Frontend - the DataTables column containing the date should be sorted as a Date object. It is being sorted like a normal string.\n- [ ] Backend - create separate JSON files for each month.\n",

      '\n\nAaron Maxwell\'s Powerful Python course looks great. It\'s outstanding because, as\nfar as I can tell, it explains abstract ideas clearly and with practical\nexamples. If becoming exceptionally good at Python ever makes it to the top of\nmy list of professional priorities then I\'d certainly take the course. For now\nthough I\'m going to make some notes on the marketing emails he send:\n\nContents:\n<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />\n\n## Good mental models:\n\n```python\ndef f(x):\n    return x+2\n```\n\nFunction `f` is a nameless function object tied to a variable called "f". You\ncan also think of it as a function called "f", but the first mental model is\nmore useful. It lets you reason about function factories, passing functions as\narguments to other functions, and writing decorators.\n\nAlso, apparently, Virginia Satir was such an incredible family therapist that\npeople wrote books about how great she was. She once said _"Most people think the\nwill to survive is the strongest instinct in humans, but it isn\'t. The strongest\ninstinct is to keep things familiar"_.\n\n## Staying motivated\n\nMost people think that motivation is about willpower, but its not. It\'s about\ncreating "wins". When you invest your time and effort, you get that "aha!"\nmoment where you see the computer do something new, or you get that feeling of a\nlittle breakthrough. It makes you excited to take another step and go a little\nfurther. And get another little win.\n\n## 95/5 rule\n\nOOP is not just a tool for organizing your code. It\'s a tool for organizing how\nyou think about code. Here is a roadmap to break into the top 1% of python\nprogrammers:\n\n- Create powerful abstractions that accelerate and amplify all the python\n  you write.\n- Write automated tests, which lets you break through the ceiling of\n  complexity, so that you can suddenly write truly complex software as easily\n  as you used to write simple software.\n- Create robust high-performance scalability - writing software than gracefully\n  handles increasing magnitudes of data without breaking a sweat.\n- Learn how to use the higher-order abstractions that the most important\n  and prominent python libraries are built on (pandas, flask, django, pytest,\n  requests).\n\n## Hidden meaning of "("\n\n```python\nclass Prefixer:\n    def __init__(self, prefix):\n        self.prefix = prefix\n    def __call__(self, message):\n        return self.prefix + message\n```\n\nUse it like:\n\n```zsh\n>>> simonsays = Prefixer("Simon says: ")\n>>> simonsays("Get up and dance!")\n\'simon says: Get up and daance!\'\n```\n\nWhat is the type of `simonsays`? If you look at just the last line you would\nthink its a function, but it is not. It is an instance of `Prefixer`.\n\nThere is a translation step. When you write "simonsays(\'foo\')" it is translated\n(kind of) to "simonsays.**call**(\'foo\')". In other words, `simonsays(` triggers\na function call.\n\nAlso:\n\n```zsh\n>>> def increment(x):\n...     return x+1\n...\n>>> increment.__call__(2)\n3\n```\n\nYou can do it with regular functions too.\nThere is a difference between the python that you write, and the python that the\ncompiler perceives. The `(` is replaced with `.__call__(`.\n\n## Current favourite python book\n\nThere are 4 levels of Python code:\n\n1.  Syntax\n1.  Idioms\n1.  Patterns\n1.

      "\n\n# Predicting port traffic using prediction markets\n\n## Background\n\nA [prediction market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market) allows people to bet on an unknown future event. For example, \"What will the Euro-Dollar exchange rate be on date X?\".\n\nIn several common forecasting scenarios, prediction markets have been more accurate than polls, expert opinions, and statistical methods[^1] and therefore prediction models are useful for observers (anybody who is interested in the outcome) and not just the market's participants. Prediction markets can be used for categorical events (a specific event that either does or doesn't happen) or scalar events (when the outcome is between a range of values). The predefined source of truth for the outcomes being predicted is called an Oracle.\n\nPrediction markets enables participants to purchase shares or tokens tied to the outcome of a specific future event. Once the event has occurred, holders of the tokens representing the actual outcome will receive a reward of predefined value. This creates an incentive to hold tokens corresponding to the correct outcome, and the market dynamics of supply and demand allow the price to reflect perceived probabilities of different outcomes. Helpfully, the price of each type of token corresponds to the relative probability of each outcome occurring which allows for simple interpretation of the results. If the reward for holding a share corresponding to the correct outcome is $1, and the present price of this share is 50 cents, then the market's estimate of the likelihood of this outcome occurring is 50%.\n\nShares can be traded continuously. As trading occurs over time the probability of different outcomes will change as new information becomes known, and the changing price of the shares quantify this.\n\n## An example\n\nLet's describe how this could work with an example:\n\nThere is a large degree of uncertainty[^2] around how Britain will continue to trade with the other European countries when it exits the EU on March 29, 2019. A prediction market will likely be a better predictor of the outcome than any other method.\n\nIf an adequate agreement isn't achieved, Britain's main port at [Dover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Dover) will certainly experience long delays and large traffic jams. Therefore a prediction market asking \"How many vehicles will be admitted into Britain at the port of Dover between 00:00 and 23:59 on March 29 2019?\" will give a useful prediction about the outcome of Britain's trade negotiations - a key component and sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.\n\nEach type of token in the prediction market will correspond to different quantities of vehicles entering the port[^3] - for example there could be four (or more) categories; Less than 8000, between 8000 and 11000, between 11000 and 14000, and more than 14000. The relative price of a share in each category will correspond to the relative probabilities of each possible outcome.\n\nIf the number of vehicles is lower than would otherwise be expected, (around 12000) this would likely be due to the impact of Brexit and thus the market will serve as a useful proxy for predicting what kind of Brexit will occur.\n\n## Stakeholder incentives are aligned\n\nOne reason that prediction markets work so well is because they aggregate information from disparate sources and the price shows not only an impartial assessment of the most likely outcome but the aggregated level of confidence that the participants have. Since no one is obliged to participate, those that do believe they have valuable information which gives them a competitive advantage. This creates a mechanism that moves good quality information into the prediction market, with the resulting prices reflecting the probability of a range of outcomes.\n\nIn our example, people with relevant information would include port employees, business owners in the UK and in Europe, politicians, civil servants, business analysts, bankers, etc. Whilst it is clear that any of these roles may have useful information or judgement about the outcome, it is not clear how useful each participants role is relative to the others. By allowing a participant to bid for as many shares in as many different categories as they want, each participant's confidence in their information can be quantified.\n\nIn this way, prediction markets align the incentives of market participants and observers. If the market is large enough then it becomes prohibitively expensive to distort the market and promote poor quality information, including information designed to create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), fake news, or alternative facts.\n\n## Market providers\n\nPrediction markets are nothing new, with political betting being used to make predictions as early as the 1500s. However the adoption of the internet and decentralised networks now allow prediction markets to be used more widely and cheaply than ever before. Gnosis is building a platform on the Ethereum blockchain on which others can build new applications which harness the power of prediction markets.\n\nBy lowering the cost and complexity of creating a prediction market, observers can benefit from high quality and impartial predictive information about future events, and market participants are rewarded for accurate assessments of likely outcomes. This will enable better decision making and empower observers with previously unobtainable insight. In our example, the market could be created and funded by any organisation that would benefit from knowing the results of the prediction market. This could be the port of Dover itself, news organisations, or market research firms. Any of these businesses would benefit from an accurate prediction.\n\n[^1]: K. J. Arrow, R. Forsythe, M.

      "\n\nI recently interviewed for a lead developer role at [Lab Digital](https://labdigital.nl/en/)[ref]Unfortunately, I didn't get the job. They wanted a senior Python developer with experience with `Infrastructure As Code`, and also working at an agency. Can't win them all.[/ref] and thought it would be sensible to review some of the fundamental aspects of Object Orientated Programming (OOP).\n\nYou might think that's a unusual way to prepare for an interview, and you'd be right. Nothing close to these notes arose during the interview, but I find this stuff interesting. If I'm motivated enough to study it, then I think that's a good enough reason by itself, without a specific reason. These are some brief notes.\n\nObject Orientated Programming has four key aspects:\n\n1. Encapsulation (Hiding information)\n2. Abstraction (Hiding the implementation)\n3. Inheritance\n4. Polymorphism\n\n## 1. Encapsulation\n\n- Each object keeps its state private, inside a class.\n- Instance variables/properties/attributes are kept private and accessor methods are made public.\n- Other objects don’t have direct access to this state. They can only call a list of public functions (methods).\n- The object manages its own state via methods, no other class can touch it unless explicitly (not default) allowed.\n- Private variables.\n- Public methods.\n- You can define classes within classes, and functions within functions.\n\n## 2. Abstraction\n\n- A natural extension of encapsulation\n- A concept or idea that is not associated with any particular instance.\n- Expresses the intent of the class, rather than a specific implementation.\n- Programs are often extremely large and separate objects communicate with each other a lot. This makes maintaining large programs difficult, and abstraction tries to solve this.\n- Applying abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it.\n  - This mechanism should hide internal implementation details. It should only reveal operations relevant for the other objects.\n  - This mechanism should be easy to use and should rarely change over time.\n- Implementation changes — for example, a software update — rarely affect the abstraction you use.\n- e.g. a coffee machine. It does a lot of stuff and makes quirky noises under the hood. But all you have to do is put in coffee and press a button.\n\n## 3. Inheritance\n\n- In OOP, objects are often similar, sharing similar logic. But they are not 100% the same.\n- Create a (child) class by deriving from another (parent) class. This way, we form a hierarchy.\n- child class reuses all fields and methods of the parent class (common part) and can implement its own unique part using method or attribute overloading.\n\n## 4. Polymorphism\n\n- Gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there’s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are.\n- This typically happens by defining a (parent) interface to be reused. It outlines a bunch of common methods. Then, each child class implements its own version of these methods.\n- Any time a collection (such as a list) or a method expects an instance of the parent (where common methods are outlined), the language takes care of evaluating the right implementation of the common method — regardless of which child is passed.\n\nI'd like to be so familiar with the following features that I can use them without referring to notes:\n\n1. Getters and setters.\n2. Instance methods compared to class methods.\n3. Inheritance, mixins, and decorators.\n4. The \"magic\" within the `Django` source code that requires `mypy` to use extensions in order to do its static type checking correctly.\n",

      "\n\n# Part 1: Design your strategy\n\n## Chapter 1: Why is product-led growth of rising importance?\n\n1. Product-Led Growth is a go-to-market (GTM) strategy that relies on using your product as the main vehicle to acquire, activate and retain customers.\n2. Product-Led Growth (PLG) means that every team influences the product:\n   - Marketing - how can our products generate a demand fly-wheel?\n   - Sales - how can we use the product to qualify our prospects for us?\n   - Customer Success - how can we create a product that helps customers become successful beyond our dreams?\n3. By having every team focussed on the product, you create a culture that is built around enduring customer value\n4. By leading with the product throughout the org, PL companies get\n   - shorter sales cycles\n   - lower Customer Acquisition Costs (CACs)\n   - higher Revenue Per Employee (RPE)\n5. A GTM strategy is an action plan that specifies how a company will reach target customers and achieve a competitive advantage\n6. In order to select a GTM, you first need to understand:\n   - market conditions\n   - competitive positioning\n   - ideal customer\n   - product offering\n7. Knowing these elements will help you choose the correct GTM that will\n   acquire, retain and grow you customer base in the most capital-efficient way\n\n### Sales-Led Go-To-Market Strategies\n\nProfit Centers: Sales, Marketing, Customer Success\n\nCost Centers: Engineering, Product\n\nAdvantages:\n\n- Annual Contract Value (ACV) can be very high\n- Enterprise first solutions that are very complex and therefore need a high-touch sales model\n- If the Total Addressable Market (TAM) is very small, because your market is super niche, you can quite easily talk to almost all market participants. (PLG is built for large TAMs)\n- It's great for new categories of product where education is required, because you need to change how people approach a problem. This takes time and requires education.\n\nThis is turn requires that you understand your customers pain points, objections, core problems. If you jump to quickly a PLG GTM strategy then you risk a high church rate because you haven't understood or educated\nyour customers well enough.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n- Sales cycles are very long\n- The Life Time Value (LTV) must be high enough to recoup the investment in\n  CAC. This often requires charging the customer a premium. This premium\n  price isn't because the product is amazing, or more valuable to the\n  customer, but because the customer acquisition model is more expensive.\n- If you use a Sales-Led GTM, you need to watch out for competitors who can\n  sell more efficiently, or have a more efficient Customer Acquisition\n  Model. They can steal your market share by offering the same product with\n  at a lower price.\n- Customer Acquisition methods are super leaky. Most marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) never result in a closed deal, this is partly because:\n  - it encourages markets to gate content in order to hit their MQL goals\n  - it focusses on content consumption as a leading indicator of intent.\n    (but reading a white-paper or brochure doesn't mean I'm going to buy\n    the thing).\n  - the entire process rewards creating friction in the buying process\n- Consequently, there is often a disconnect between marketing and sales\n\n### Product-Led Go-To-Market Strategies\n\n- Switching from Sales-Led GTM to Product-Led GTM creates a defensive moat\n- A product led marketing team asks \"How can we use the product to qualify our prospects for us?\"\n- A product led customer success team asks \"How can we create a product that helps customers be successful without our help?\"\n- A product-led engineering team asks \"How can we create a product with a quick time-to-value?\"\n- Growth is much faster, because:\n  - you need fewer resources to scale,\n  - the top of the customer funnel is much wider.\n  - CAC is much lower\n  - Higher RPE (revenue per employee)\n  - User experience is better\n\n## Chapter 2 - Free, Freemium or Demo\n\n1. Use the MOAT framework to pick the right GTM strategy:\n   - **M**arket Strategy - Dominant? Disruptive? Differentiated?\n   - **O**cean Conditions - Blue or Red?\n   - **A**udience - Do you have a top-down or bottom-up marketing strategy?\n   - **T**ime to Value - How much time do you need for a customer to\n     experience the value?\n\n- Dominant - Do it better than the competition _and_ charge a lower price\n  - Is your TAM big enough?\n  - Does your product solve a specific job significantly better and at lower cost than anyone else on the market?\n  - Can the user realize significant ongoing value quickly with little or no help?\n  - Do you want to be the undisputed market leader?\n- Differentiated - Pick and win a fight against an industry giant\n  - Main line of defense against the giant is specialization\n  - Focus on an underserved niche\n  - Do a specific job better than the competition but charge significantly more\n  - This is not a one-size-fits-all model.\n  - Free trials and demos work well here.\n  - Because its specialized, combining freemium with quick time-to-value is difficult\n  - Main competitive advantage is how you solve your customers problems\n  - Does your market have underserved customers?\n  - Is the TAM big enough?\n  - is the ACV high enough?\n  - Could prospects experience a Magic Moment during a free trial?\n- Disruptive - Charge less for an inferior product (e.g. Canva, Google docs)\n  - Build a simpler product that solves a specific pain point, and because its simpler, its faster, you can charge less, and its more appropriate to some over-served or priced-out customers\n  - It's a scaled-down product\n  - Costs must be low\n  - Product must be easy to use\n  - Is TAM large enough?\n  - Can on-boarding be completely self-service?\n  - Freemium model thrives\n\n## Chapter 3 - Red-Ocean or Blue-Ocean markets?\n\nRed-ocean companies try to outperform their rivals in order to grab a larger share of the existing market. As the market gets crowded, opportunity for profit and growth reduces. Products become commodities. Cut-throat competition turns the waters red.\n\nBlue-ocean companies access untapped market space and create demand. They have opportunity for highly profitable growth. Competition is irrelevant. Create and capture new demand.\n\nSome markets will be red-ocean, but a particular niche within it will be blue ocean.\n\nBlue Oceans require educating the customer to create the demand. This is high-touch, and often a PL GTM strategy isn't going to work. It needs to be sales-led in order to educate the customer enough. But if Time-To-Value (TTV) is short then PLG could be great.\n\nRed Oceans need big wide funnels in order to compete, and PL GTM strategies work great. They're defensible, keep costs low and make sales cycles short.\n\n## Chapter 4 - Top-Down or Bottom-Up selling strategy?\n\n1. PLG works for bottom-up.\n2. High touch sales-led strategies work for Top-Down enterprise sales strategies, where the product is super complex and the sales cyccle is very long.\n\nTop-Down (Sales team is the growth engine):\n\n- High ACV\n- Additional Services\n- Lower customer churn\n- Poor revenue distribution\n- High CAC\n- Long sales cycles\n- Free Trial sometimes works\n\nBottom-Up (Product is the growth engine):\n\n- Wider top-of-funnel\n- Low CAC\n- Predictable sales figures\n- Revenue diversity\n- Scalable fast\n- Small contracts only\n- non-paying customers\n- expertise shortage\n- upfront investment as non-paying customers drain resources\n- Freemium\n- Free-Trial\n\n## Chapter 5 - Time-to-Value\n\n1. How much time until you deliver on your promise to prospects?\n2. How much time until the product sells itself?\n3. PL GTM strategies require fast time-to-value.\n4. Rank your uses across 2 dimensions and group into 4 quadrants. The dimensions are Ability (low - high) and Motivation (low - high) 5. Low Motivation - Low Ability = Mission Impossible 6. High Motivation - Low Ability = Rookie 7. Low Motivation - High Ability = Veteran 8. High Motivation - High Ability = Spoiled\n5. Figure out your top two quadrants. Unless all your users are Spoiled, you need to decrease Time-To-Value.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- How motivated are your users?\n- Is your product easy for your target audience to use?\n- Can users experience the core value (magic moment?) without hand-holding?\n\n# Part 2 - Build Your Foundation\n\n## Chapter 7 - Build a product-led foundation\n\nA positive feedback loop:\n\n1. **Understand** your value\n2. **Communicate** it\n3. **Deliver** on your promise\n4. Repeat\n\n## Chapter 8 - Understand your value\n\nIf you're selling live-chat software, you're not really selling live-chat software, you are selling a new and better way to acquire customers.\n\nYou are selling the outcome, the result, the why.\n\nPain makes us want to change so that we can avoid or prevent the pain altogether.\n\nPain is product agnostic.\n\nThere are three reasons why people buy a product:\n\n1. Functional Outcome - the core task that needs to get done.\n2. Emotional Outcome - how a customer wants to feel or avoid feeling as a result of the functional outcome.\n3. Social Outcome - how a customer wants to be perceived by others by using\n   your product.\n\nIn every software, there are usage patterns that point towards to core outcomes that are most important to customers.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between sales-led and product-led companies is that SL companies monitor usage patters to see if users are accomplishing meaningful outcomes. These outcomes are referred to as **value-metrics**.\n\n**A value-metric is the way you measure value exchange in your product**. They are the linchpin to successful execution of a product-led GTM strategy because you are aligning your revenue model directly with your customer acquisition model. Because your value metrics play a vital role in how you price your product, set up your monitoring, and build your team.\n\nValue metrics could be:\n\n- for Vimeo, number of videos uploaded by the user.\n- for Slack, number of messages sent by the user\n- for PayPal, amount of revenue generated by the user (processed?)\n\nThere are **functional** and **outcome based** value metrics. Functional value metrics are \"per user\" or \"per 100 videos\". Pricing scales around functions of usage. Outcome based value metrics charge based on the outcome, e.g. how many views a video received, or how much money a customer made when using your payment process method.\n\nMany SaaS companies rely on feature differentiation as a way to justify higher prices, but this produces higher churn.\n\nValue metrics outperform feature differentiation with upto 75% less churn...\n\nOutcome based value metrics reduce church by an additional 40%. Apparently.\n\n1. A good value metric is easy for a customer to understand. They need to immediately understand what they're paying for and where they fit in your packing/pricing structure. If you're in an established market, it makes senses to look at what the competition charges.\n2. A good value metric is aligned with the value that the customer receives through the product. Consider the low-level components of your high-level outcome. E.g. what low level actions are necessary to get the end result? Sending lots of messages? Meeting lots of people? Finding lots of things?\n3. A good value metric grows with your customers usage of the valuable outcome. If customers get incredible value from the product, charge them more because the product is worth it. Also, if they aren't getting much value from the product, charge them less.\n4. Don't do user based pricing if you want to get lots of users - its a conflict of interests.\n5. If you're small, you can try different pricing strategies and iterate to success.\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n1. What do my best customers do?\n2. What do my best customers not do?\n3. What features did my best customers try first when they were on-boarding?\n4. What are the similarities along my best customers that led to success?\n5. For churned customers, what were the main differences between them and the\n   best customers? Were they in the ideal audience? Why did they church? What\n   did they do or not do that good customers didn't?\n",

      '\n\nThe chapter starts with <mark>"Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he\nwho hates reproof is stupid."</mark> and ends with <mark>"In the path of\nrighteousness is life, and in its pathway there is no death."</mark>\n\nThe opening proverb is jarring to read, maybe because unlike "wickedness" or "righteousness",\nwhich are concepts I don\'t hear or think much about day-to-day, "discipline" and\n"knowledge" are very familiar and part of contemporary conversation. So is\nstupidity. So this proverb feels tangible.\n\nWhat does it mean? If I love discipline then I am loving knowledge, and in this\ncase I\'m confident the opposite is also true - If I avoid or dislike discipline\nthen I avoid or dislike knowledge. Discipline is hard, I guess I need to lean\ninto being disciplined, and remember why.\n\nEncouragingly, the proverb is immediately followed by the reminder that <mark>"A good\nman obtains favour from the Lord, but a man of evil devices he condemns"</mark>, so\nmake an effort, do good things, and obtain favour. That\'s a big reason to\npersevere through discipline.\n\n$^4$<mark>"An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she who brings\nshame is like rottenness in his bones."</mark> If it were me I\'d leave off all\nthe negative second parts of these proverbs, its abrasive. But also if it were\nme I doubt they\'d be worth studying.\n\nWhy is the pattern of all these proverbs "good thing, bad thing" - to make the\ncontrast stronger? To know why to do a thing and also why not to do the\nopposite? To make it more punchy? I guess if its abrasive you are more likely to\nremember it, and if you\'re confident that what you are saying is true then you\nwant it to be remembered.\n\nBack to the proverb, this is a great proverb - I like it. It honors wives,\nthough it does put them in the context of their husbands, and it also speaks to\nhow valuable and precious a good wife is - crowns are precious and rare.\n\nEmpirically, it also feels _thruthy_ - marriages are difficult and if either\nspouse can be considered "excellent" then that is unusual and valuable.\nRelationships can give a lot of life and health and happiness, and require a lot\nof effort and work. To be an excellent spouse is certainly worth desiring and\ncelebrating and protecting.\n\nThe next few verses contrast wickedness and righteousness - don\'t be wicked, be\nupright!\n\n$^9$ <mark>"Better to be lowly and have a servant that to play the great man and lack\nbread"</mark>. Don\'t put appearances before substance? Don\'t spend money on fancy cars\nor clothes if you wont have enough for decent food? Prioritize substance\n(truth?) over appearances and social pressures? Having a servant (or a domestic\nhelper) would certainly be helpful, and of more tangible benefit than receiving\nshout-outs at networking events.\n\n$^{10}$ <mark>"Whoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast, but the mercy of the\nwicked is cruel."</mark> - animal welfare is important.\n\n$^{11}$ <mark>Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who\nfollows worthless pursuits lacks sense.</mark>\n\n11 and 12 are both about enjoying the good consequences of honest work, 11\nadvises against worthless pursuits, and 12 says that is a wicked to covet the\nprofits of evildoers.\n\nVerses 13 - 19 are all about speaking and listening. Each proverb contrasts good and\nevil or wisdom and foolishness.\n\n- 13 - your own dishonest words will become a trap for you.\n- 14 - you words and your works will come back to you - invest in them and dividends will be returned.\n- 17, 18 - these contrast each other. Your words are powerful,\n  speaking the truth is honest (even when it isn\'t simple, or if it makes a\n  situation more complicated) and being rash (acting without careful\n  consideration of the consequences) can be as violent as wielding a sword. Wise\n  words bring healing, though.\n\n$^{15}$ Fools think they are right, and because of the contrasting pattern\npresumably do not listen to (or ask for) advice. This seems similar to the\n[Dunning-Kruger\nEffect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) Wise people\nknow that they don\'t know everything they need to, ask for advice, and listen to\nit.\n\n$^{16}$ I had to look up _Vexation_ - it means "the state of being annoyed,\nfrustrated or worried". Wise people can stay calm and ignore insults. If you\nget all fired up when someone insults you you\'re probably (generally speaking)\nbeing foolish.\n\n$^{19}$ <mark>Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue is but for a\nmoment.</mark>\n\nTruth endures, lies do not.\n\nVerses 20 - 29 have two themes - the benefits of consistent hard work, and the\nbenefits of being truthful. As usual, each proverb is a comparison of right and\nwrong or wisdom and foolishness:\n\n$^{21}$ <mark>No ill befalls the righteous, but the wicked are filled with\ntrouble.</mark> This is encouraging to read, and also highlights that proverbs\nhighlight truthful patterns, but are not specific guarantees. - Obviously\nrighteous people will have trouble, this proverb isn\'t saying that life will be\nperfectly pleasant. As usual, it is a push towards doing good because of the\nbenefits, a pull away from doing wrong because of the damage.\n\n$^{22}$ <mark>.. those who act faithfully are his delight.</mark> It is\nwonderful to read that (a good) God would delight in people.\n\n$^{23}$ <mark>A prudent man conceals knowledge, but the heart of a fool\nproclaims knowledge.</mark> I find it surprising to read that concealing\nknowledge can be a desirable trait. I guess there are certain questions that\nmust be answered before the answers to other questions can be understood, and I\nknow that for my young children I wouldn\'t answer particular questions that same\nas if they were adults.\n\n$^{24}$ <mark>The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be\nput to forced labor.</mark> Its ironic, and counter-intuitive, that those who are\ndiligent and able and willing to labor end up in management or leadership\npositions, and that those who would avoid laborious work end up doing it.\n\n$^{25}$ <mark>Anxiety in a man\'s heart weighs him down, but a good word makes\nhim glad.</mark> I find it encouraging (again) to read that being weighed down\nby anxiety is normal, and I like that anxiety isn\'t described as a weakness or as\nfoolishness. (I don\'t want to conjecture too much about what isn\'t written, but\nthere\'s a long list of things that fools do and the consequences of foolishness,\nand anxiety isn\'t on the list.) This proverb also emphasises and\nencourages the impact of good words.\n\n$^{28}$ <mark>In the path of righteousness is life, and in its pathway there is\nno death.</mark> How wonderful to know how to find life and avoid death. It\'s\nsuch a pleasing way to end a chapter.\n',

      "\n\n$^{1}$<mark>A wise son hears his father's instruction, but a scoffer does not listen\nto rebuke.</mark> The chapter opens the same way as the previous chapter - with a\nproverb about the importance of wisdom, knowledge or instruction. As always, the\nproverb starts with the good example and then contrasts against it.\n\n$^{2}$<mark>From the fruit of his mouth a man eats what is good, but the desire of\nthe treacherous is violence.</mark> Slightly weird imagery I think, my mouth\nproduces fruit that I can then eat.. Weird. But I can see the principle - the\nfruit of my mouth is the words I speak, words are powerful for either good or\nevil. Speaking well will lead to good things that do what good food does -\nnourish, strengthen, sustain. Treacherous people desire violence. So are people who\nwant to do violent things likely to betray? Maybe.\n\n$^{3}$<mark>He who guards his mouth preserves his life, he who opens wide his lips\ncomes to ruin.</mark> Choose your words carefully.\n\n$^{5}$<mark>The righteous hates falsehood, but the wicked brings shame and\ndisgrace.</mark> It's OK to be strongly opposed to be falsehoods -\nmisrepresentations, lies, manipulation, duplicity.\n\n$^{6}$<mark>Righteousness guards him whose way is blameless, but sin overthrows\nthe wicked.</mark> I guess there are (at least) 2 ways of looking at this - the\nonly way I can be blameless is by Jesus' imputed righteousness, which also saves\nme literally from death. The alternative is that I am not righteous and am\novercome by sin. Alternatively and more prosaically, try to be blameless instead\nof wicked, and instead of creating trouble for yourself you'll find people bear\nwith you for longer and are nicer to you.\n\n$^{7}$ <mark>One pretends to be rich, yet has nothing. Another pretends to be\npoor, yet has great wealth.</mark> (I prefer not to use semicolons) I really\nlike this proverb! The last 20 years have seen several degrees of financial\nwealth or lack, and the reality has often been very different to what I'd\nexpected. I often intuit that things must get easier, or nicer, or more\nfulfilling if only a certain problem was removed, or a certain something was\nbought, or recognised, or achieved. The reality is a lot more complicated than\nthat. Wealth isn't what I thought it was, I thought it was mostly financial.\nNow, I think its freedom. Freedom to be at peace, to be unburdened of my past\nand present, freedom to still have hope for the future, freedom to have some\nspare time, freedom to not be crushed by life and be a good dad and husband and\nfriend.\n\n$^{8}$<mark>The ransom of a man's life is his wealth, but a poor man hears no\nthreat.</mark> oh! Incisive! This reminds me of \"no one ever really owns\na fortune, it always seems to own them\". There are various troubles and burdens\nyou avoid by being poor, like choosing life instead of material excess. Lose\nyour wealth and choose a rich life.\n\n$^{10}$<mark>By insolence[ref]Insolence: rude and disrespectful\nbehaviour\"[/ref] comes nothing but strife, but with those who take advice is\nwisdom.</mark> Disrespect and rudeness never works, wisdom is acquired when you\nmake a habit of asking for advice.\n\n$^{11}$<mark>Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by\nlittle will increase it.</mark> I'm surprised to read this - I didn't realise\nthat the rate of change of ones wealth would likely effect how it can be\nsustained, and I wouldn't have guessed that this is some general principle that\nexists across millennia, cultures and geographies.\n\n$^{12}$<mark>Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a desire fulfilled is a\ntree of life.</mark> This one I've heard before. I don't really understand it,\nthough. I'm not sure what a sick heart definitely is.\n\nIt seems counter-intuitive because we are told to keep on looking forward to and\nhoping for Jesus to complete his work saving us and bringing history to\ncompletion. There is a lot of \"now and not yet\" tensions in between the time of\nJesus' resurrection and second coming (I know so little about it that I don't\nparticularly want to mention it). So maybe a Christian's heart would be expected\nto be a little sick?\n\nAlso, if _a desire fulfilled is a tree of life_ then I guess I'm desiring the\nwrong kind of things - most of my desires are chasing after the wind. I desire\nto eat and then I get hungry again, desire to graduate and then realise the work\nhasn't even begun, etc. The image of a _Tree of life_ hasn't been used before I\ndon't think, maybe it means something specific which I'm unaware of. There was a\ntree of life in the garden of Eden...\n\n13 - 16: Don't ignore wisdom, don't be an idiot, be prudent, have good sense.\nStrong recurring themes. $^{16}$<mark>Every prudent man acts with knowledge,\nbut a fool flaunts his folly</mark> is interesting though - I think prudence is\nbeing used in a slightly different sense to what I'm used to. This proverb is\nsaying that one should be informed before acting. And because a fool rushes into\naction, it will be clear that the don't know what they are doing or talking\nabout.\n\n$^{22}$ <mark>A good man lays up an inheritance for his children's children,\nbut the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous.</mark> I remember reading\nthis when I was about 18 and thinking this was quite a burden - to leave an\ninheritance for grandchildren as well as children.\n\nSeventeen years later it makes a lot of sense - the inheritance isn't primarily money,\nbut wisdom, peace, security. The way that I parent my children will directly\neffect how they parent their own children, and in this way I will either bless\nor curse my grandchildren.\n\nIf I damage my children, they will suffer and be less able to provide for their\nown children (emotionally, physically, spiritually). Our own childhoods have a\nlarge influence on our adulthoods, and our ability to parent, so I should make\nsure my children have good childhoods, which is not a trivial endeavour.\n\n23 and 24 break the pattern of \"good example, bad example.\"\n\n$^{23}$ <mark>The fallow[ref]Fallow: ploughed and harrowed but left for a period without\nbeing sown in order to restore its fertility or to avoid surplus\nproduction[/ref] ground of the poor would yield much food, but it is swept away\nthrough injustice.</mark> The missed opportunities are real. Poor people are not\nincapable of productive and fruitful work. It is injustice that prevents\nfruitfulness. I find this proverb subtly provocative and insightful.\n\n$^{24}$ <mark>Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is\ndiligent to discipline him.</mark> Parents who love their children do not enjoy\ncausing them stress or discomfort, but if they love them and are wise then they\ndiscipline diligently, or consistently. Apparently physical punishment is timeless?\n\n$^{25}$ <mark>The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the belly of\nthe wicked suffers want.</mark> The last proverb in the chapter finishes with\nencouragement that it is better to be righteous than wicked, because it leads to\nsatisfaction rather than want.\n\nThe previous chapter also finished with encouragement specifically about\nrighteousness. Even though the book doesn't have headings it seems like it does\nhave structure, and the author requires you to actually read the text closely in\norder to pull out meaning. Shocking. Clearly not optimised for engagement,\nSEO or social media.\n\n[comment]: #\n",

      "\n\n$^{1}$<mark>The wisest of women builds her house, but folly with her own hands\ntears it down.</mark> This chapter begins with a proverb about women! And not by\njuxtaposing men either. It's important that I remember that wisdom - the\ndesirable quality that so much of proverbs is about - is personified as a woman,\nlike in chapter 9:1, _Wisdom has built her house, she has hewn[ref]Hewn: chop or\ncut with an const[/ref] her seven pillars._\n\n$^{2}$<mark>Whoever walks in uprightness fears the Lord, but he who is devious\nin his ways despises him.</mark> Fear is contrasted with despising, so I don't\nthink this is supposed to fear of violence or victimisation, but more like a\nfeeling of reverence and profound respect. The Lord loves me, and in the\nprevious chapter it says that parents discipline their children.\n\n$^{4}$<mark>Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean, but abundant crops\ncome by the strength of the ox.</mark> This is really interesting, the point\nfeels modern. The rural imagery is unusual (to me) but otherwise it feels\nlike something you might find on Instagram. What's the lesson? Progress is\nmessy, or doing work creates waste, don't fret about the cleanliness of your\nmanger if you want to have a productive farm..\n\n$^{5}$<mark>A faithful witness does not lie, but a false witness breathes out\nlies.</mark> It's really important - don't lie. This is a strong recurring\nmessage.\n\n$^{6}$<mark>A scoffer seeks wisdom in vain, but knowledge is easy for a man of\nunderstanding.</mark> What does he understand? That scoffing is harmful to the\nscoffer, and what else?\n\n$^{7}$<mark>Leave the presence of a fool, for there you do not meet words of\nknowledge.</mark> It would be good to have a clearer understanding of the\ndifferences between _understanding_ and _knowledge_. This proverb is very\nsimilar to modern sayings like \"You become like the 5 people you spend most time\nwith\". What are the marks of a fool? How do you know if you're hanging out with\na foolish person? They talk a lot, without thinking about their words. They are\nquick to become angry or emotional. They are not diligent, or consistently hard\nworking. They don't plan ahead (filling their barns in summer).\n\n$^{8}$<mark>The wisdom of the prudent is to discern his way, but the folly of\nfools is deceiving.</mark> It's wise, and prudent, to discern a course of\naction, or series of events and decisions. Discern means \"recognise or find\nout\", I tend to use it to \"look closely for additional clues about what might happen\".\n\"Prudent\" means to \"act or demonstrate care and thought for the future\".\n\n$^{10}$<mark>The heart knows its own bitterness, and no stranger shares its\njoy.</mark> This, I think, makes total sense to an old person and seems\nmysterious to young people. When I first read it I thought it said something\nlike \"no-one shares its joy\", but it doesn't. Only \"stranger\". Family and close\nfriends can share joy, but they still won't be able to know your bitterness. I'd\nrecommend not holding onto bitterness, and finding out how its possible to\nforgive because of the work that Jesus completed.\n\n$^{11}$<mark>The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the\nupright will flourish.</mark> Again, don't be wicked, it will go badly for you.\nIf you are upright and living in a humble, fragile, vulnerable tent\nyou can still flourish.\n\n$^{12}$<mark>There is a way that seems right to a man, but it's end is the way\nto death.</mark>This book doesn't pull any punches. It's an alarming assertion\nthat someone can think they are doing things \"right\" but are in fact heading\ntowards death. Don't rely on your own understanding, figure out what God thinks\nabout a thing.\n\n$^{13}$<mark>Even in laughter the heart may ache, and the end of joy may be\ngrief.</mark>At the moment I don't have much experience of grief, but I\ninevitably will. I know there is sorrow so profound that it becomes physical as\nwell as emotional, and regret that changes what it means to be alive. I guess\none of the things this proverb reveals is that its ok to laugh whilst\nexperiencing heart ache, and its natural to feel happy and sad (laughing and\nheart-aching) at the same time. It's part of being alive emotionally, and\nshouldn't be considered weird or broken.\n\n14 and 15 reiterate themes I've noted previously.\n\n$^{16}$<mark>One who is wise is cautious and turns away from evil, but a fool is\nreckless and careless.</mark> It is wise to not do something, even if you could.\nYou don't have to do/see/visit all the things, even if you could. It's ok to\nrisk erring on the side of cautious, because if you are not cautious, you are\nfoolish.\n\nI guess that if you are discerning then you can perceive more clearly and what\nwas originally partially known and therefore risky becomes less risky because\nthere are fewer unknowns. Instead of \"maybe its wrong\" it can become \"its almost\ndefinitely wrong, or right\"\n\n$^{17}$<mark>A man of quick temper acts foolishly, and a man of evil devices is\nhated.</mark> Don't lose your temper quickly. Losing it slowly is often more\ndifficult.\n\n$^{18}$<mark>The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with\nknowledge.</mark> You're supposed to aspire to prudence (and more generally,\nwisdom). You can't really opt out of this, because if you're not\nwise then you're a fool. If you're not prudent, you are (too) simple. And bad\nthings happen to fools.\n\n$^{19}$<mark>The evil bow down before the good, the wicked at the gates of the\nrighteous.</mark> It's surprising to read such bold and simple confidence that\njustice would prevail. No ifs or maybes or conditions, just a simple resolution\nat the end.\n\n$^{20}$<mark>The poor is disliked even by his neighbour, but the rich has many\nfriends.</mark> Timeless pragmatism. This proverb is an observation, not a\ncommendation. And look at the next proverb.\n\n$^{21}$<mark>Whoever despises his neighbour is a sinner, but the blessed is he\nwho is generous to the poor.</mark>. Be generous, not just theoretically or in\nyour thoughts, but also in your actions and your money (see 23). Don't despise people.\nWho is your neighbour?\n\n$^{22}$<mark>...Those who devise good meet steadfast love and\nfaithfulness.</mark> Steadfast love and faithfulness.\n\n$^{23}$<mark>In all toil there is profit, but mere talk leads only to\npoverty.</mark> It's not enough to only talk about loving your neighbour. And\ndon't be convinced that any hard work you do it totally wasted, apparently it is\nnot.\n\n$^{24}$<mark>The crown of the wise is their wealth, but the folly of fools\nbrings folly.</mark> Really? Does _wealth_ here mean something more or different\nto financial wealth? (I think I asked this in a previous proverb.) Not all wise\npeople are rich, this is certain. And many biblical heroes were financially\nimpoverished. Is it just a wide generalization?\n\n$^{25}$<mark>A truthful witness saves lives..</mark> Literally. Though probably\nwithout knowing exactly which lives, and at what moment. Investors refer to this\nas second order consequences.\n\n$^{26}$<mark>In the fear of the Lord one has strong confidence, and his children\nwill have refuge.</mark> The best that I can understand this is to read it the\nsame as if it said \"In the Lord one has strong confidence..\". What does this\nproverb mean that my shortened simplified version doesn't?\n\n$^{27}$<mark>The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, that one may turn away\nfrom the snares of death.</mark> Turning away is like physically repenting. A fountain\nof life is a source of life, and probably health and healing. It is contrasted\nwith death traps. It would be interesting to consider the relative importance of\nfeelings and actions in this book. Is it that feelings lead to actions, but\nactions are what makes the difference - the judgement between wisdom and\nfoolishness, love and hatred, depends (only) on your actions?\n\n$^{28}$<mark>In a multitude of people is the glory of a king, but without people\na prince is ruined.</mark>If a king doesn't have any subjects, what is he king\nof? If leaders are not followed by any people, they cannot claim to be leaders.\n\n$^{29}$<mark>Whoever is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has a\nhasty temper exalts folly.</mark>If you have a quick temper then you are\nresponsible for it, and you are endorsing foolishness. Being slow to anger is a\nsign of wisdom.\n\n$^{30}$<mark>A tranquil heart gives life to the flesh, but envy makes the bones\nrot.</mark> Envy is apparently really bad. Tranquility is freedom from\ndisturbance, or being calm. It's good for your health.\n\n$^{31}$<mark>Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his maker, but he who is\ngenerous to the needy honors him.</mark> The poor mater, and have dignity, and\nare worthy of respect, because we are all made.\n",

      "\n\n$^{1}$<mark>A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up\nanger.</mark> A soft answer can diffuse a volatile situation, and speaking\nharshly leads to anger.\n\n$^{2}$<mark>The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouths of fools\npoor out folly.</mark> Knowledge is to be commended. If someone speaks a lot of\nfolly, they are a fool. Folly is \"foolishness or a lack of good sense\" - it'll\ntake discernment to judge a lack of good sense. Find someone who commends\nacquiring knowledge, and learning.\n\n$^{3}$<mark>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil\nand the good.</mark> Don't mistake God's patience for indifference, know that\nyour good works and faithfulness are seen.\n\n$^{4}$<mark>A gentle tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it breaks the\nspirit.</mark> Yet again, this book teaches that our words are powerful and have\ngreat consequence. A gentle tongue, a soft answer, guarded words preserver\nlife, good fruit, fountain of life, now a tree of life. It is unequivocal, as is\nthe inverse.\n\n$^{5}$<mark>A fool despises his father's instruction but whoever heeds reproof\nis prudent.</mark> I just had a thought that people younger than 10 would have a\ndifficult time heeding or despising, and are too young to be considered wise or\nfoolish. They are children. When proverbs refers to parents and children, I\nreckon its probably referring to either adult children and maybe teenagers. I\nhave young kids so I'm predisposed to see parenting advice in that context.\n\n$^{7}$<mark>The lips of the wise spread knowledge, not so the hearts of\nfools.</mark> What you say is important..\n\n$^{8}$<mark>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but the\nprayers of the upright are acceptable to him.</mark> Integrity matters, and it\nseems that God is more concerned with motivation than impact. Better to pray\nquietly and honestly than to hypocritically do good works in public.\n\n$^{11}$<mark>Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the Lord, how much more the\nhearts of the children of man!</mark> I am guessing that Sheol and Abaddon are\nsome reference to a hellish place - if God can perceive what happens in a\ncompletely godless place that is far from him, it is going to be trivial\nto perceive the thoughts and motivations of your heart. He can read us like an\nopen book.\n\n$^{12}$<mark>A scoffer does not like to be reproved, he will not go to the\nwise.</mark> Reproof is almost as strong of a theme as words. Reproof is part of\ngrowing up and becoming wise. You _must_ be reproved if you are to learn and\nbecome wise. If I do not reprove my children then I am negligent. If you want to\navoid reproof or do not accept it then you are a fool.\n\nBut remember, these are proverbs - they are generally true, most of the time.\nThere will be situations where you parent gives bad advice and you'd be wise to\nignore it. But its the exception, not the rule. If everyone else is the problem,\nthen the problem is certainly you.\n\n$^{13}$<mark>A glad heart makes a cheerful face, but by sorrow the spirit is\ncrushed.</mark> This proverb connections emotions, spirit and the physical body.\nIt says they are linked. If you are happy then you will look happy, and vice\nversa. If you carry around stress and tension then it's going to change how you\nlook. Don't be sad indefinitely, it will crush you.\n\nGrieve, and grow, and move on.\n\n$^{14}$<mark>The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge, but the\nmouths of fools feed on folly.</mark> This isn't talking about the consequences\nof your words, it says that if you have understanding then your heart will\ndesire knowledge. If you feed on folly, which is like consuming things that are\nfoolish, then you are a fool.\n\n$^{15}$<mark>All the days of the afflicted are evil, but the cheerful of heart\nhas a continual feast.</mark> A pessimist and an optimist could experience the\nsame event and become respectively more pessimistic and more optimistic. As much\nas you are able, choose to have a cheerful heart. If you are afflicted, then don't\ngive up hope. Affliction doesn't mean you did something wrong or lack wisdom.\n\n$^{16}$<mark>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasure and\ntrouble with it.</mark> So the fear of the Lord leads to the avoidance of\ntrouble.. and it is better to live peaceably than deal with trouble.\n\n$^{17}$<mark>Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a fattened ox and\nhatred with it.</mark> Better to eat only garnishes, or bait, with people who\nlove you than fine dining with people who do not.\n\n$^{18}$<mark>A hot-tempered man stirs up strife but he who is slow to anger\nquiets contention.</mark> Don't lose your temper. Blessed are the peace-makers..\n\n$^{22}$<mark>Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they\nsucceed.</mark> You're not supposed to know everything and be completely\nindependent. You are supposed to ask for help, weigh the advice, and\ndeliberately look for wise people to be friends with.\n\n$^{23}$<mark>To make an apt[ref]Apt: Appropriate or suitable in the\ncircumstances.[/ref] answer is a joy to a man, and a word in season, how good it\nis!</mark> It is fun to say something apt? It is a blessing to receive a bit of\nwell-timed advice.\n\nProverbs talks a lot about words and mouths. For most of history, books have\nbeen rare and literacy was not widespread. Therefore most knowledge transfer\nwould occur by speaking. Maybe it still does today because it feels like it\nrequires less effort than reading. I think the same principles can be applied to\nreading and writing as for hearing and speaking.\n\n$^{25}$<mark>The Lord tears down the house of the proud but maintains the\nwidow's boundaries.</mark> The boundaries are the edges of the land owned by the\nwidow. God really doesn't like proud people, and is soft-hearted towards the\nvulnerable.\n\n$^{27}$<mark>He who is greedy for unjust gain troubles his own household, but he\nwho hates bribes will live.</mark> Don't be a fool, don't be bribed - directly\nor indirectly. Love life, look after your family, and hate bribes. Loving one\nthing means you hate other things. If you're building a business, design for\nSegregation of Duties.\n\n$^{28}$<mark>The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer but the mouth of\nthe wicked pours out evil things.</mark> It is good, and Godly, to think about\nyour answer _before_ you say it.\n\n$^{33}$<mark>The fear of the Lord is instruction in wisdom, and humility comes\nbefore honor.</mark> Ok great - I have a definition for what \"fear of the Lord\"\nmeans. (And it's a reliable definition too.) I still don't understand _why_ this\nis what it means, but at least I know _what_ it means. They _why_ question is\nless foundational that the _what_.\n\nLearn humility, despise pride. Seek wisdom.\n",

      "\n\nThe first 9 verses seem to loosely be about plans and the motivations for\nvarious actions. The wisdom and purpose of God's actions are contrasted with the\nmotivations of human plans.\n\nThe first proverb is a bit of a riddle. $^{1}$<mark>The plans of the heart\nbelong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord.</mark> I get the\nfirst part, but why would a spoken answer generally be from God? Is it that even\nif you are wise, and fear God, your plans are still your own but the way you\nspeak about them is different because you fear God?\n\n$^{2}$<mark>All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs\nthe spirit.</mark> Don't be surprised that foolish, stupid or evil people think\nthat their actions and decisions are upstanding and good. Understand that God\nsays the spirit (motivation or attitude) that produced the plan or the actions\nis what should be judged. I don't think that God would agree that \"the ends\njustifies the means\".\n\n$^{3}$<mark>Commit your work to the Lord and your plans will be\nestablished.</mark> A good proverb for fridge magnets.\n\n$^{4}$<mark>The Lord has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for\nthe day of trouble.</mark> The mysteries around moral responsibility from\nfree will and predestination are not unique to the New Testament. I can't think\nof anything useful to say in order to expand on this. I believe it's true, I\ndon't really know what I would do differently now that I've read this proverb. I\ncan trust God that he knows what he's doing and that he is _good_. I'll add it\nto my list of things I know about God without taking anything else off the list.\n\n$^{5}$<mark>Everyone who is arrogant[ref]Arrogant: Having or revealing an\nexaggerated sense of ones own importance or abilities.[/ref] in heart is an\nabomination to the Lord, be assured he will not go unpunished.</mark> God really\ndoesn't like arrogance, which seems very similar to pride. This is troubling\nbecause society seems to have lost any appreciation for humility to the point\nwhere we no longer know how to talk about the virtues and vices of humility and\npride. Pride is considered a virtue and is conflated with self-worth. We lack\nthe nuance required to reliably discern wisdom from folly.\n\n$^{6}$<mark>By steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for, and by\nthe fear of the Lord one turns away from evil.</mark> It is refreshing and\npleasant to read about _Steadfast love and faithfulness_.\n\nI don't hear many people talking about these virtues - love has been reduced or\nredefined as something that can be found or changed quickly.\n\nFaithfulness isn't celebrated or spoken about very much. Maybe because it isn't\nas dramatic as betrayal. Faithfulness and steadfast love are predicated on\nhumility, which is another concept society seems silent about.\n\nThe second half of the proverb is also profound. It tells me how I can turn away\nfrom evil. I know that it is easier to say I will change my ways than it is to\nactually change, consistently.\n\n\"Being good\" or \"turning away from evil\" is not nearly as easy or simple as a\nchild thinks it is, and this proverb tells me how to do it. The last proverb of\nthe previous chapter said that the fear of the lord is instruction in wisdom,\nand that humility comes before honor.\n\n$^{8}$<mark>Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues with\ninjustice.</mark> In case there was any doubt, here it is. Don't compromise\nyourself in order to make more money.\n\n$^{9}$<mark>The heart of a man plans his way, but the Lord\nestablishes[ref]Establish: Set up on a firm or permanent basis.[/ref] his\nsteps.</mark> So I can make my own plans, but if my plans are to be successful,\nor substantial, I need the Lord to make my plans \"firm\" or \"permanent\".\n\n$^{10}$<mark>An oracle is on the lips of a king, his mouth does not sin in\njudgement.</mark> I don't know what this means. An oracle is \"a priest acting as\na medium through whom advice or prophecy was sought from the gods.\" Kings have\ncertainly sinned when making judgements.\n\n$^{11}$<mark>A just balance and scales are the Lords, all the weights in the bag\nare his work.</mark> God loves justice, and the instruments or justice are\nultimately his, and are from him.\n\n$^{12}$<mark>It is an abomination to kings to do evil, for the throne is\nestablished by righteousness.</mark> The kings in verses 12 and 10 are not like\nkings I have heard about. If 12 is true then perhaps 10 can be true. At a\nminimum, 12 and 13 provides some standard by which to judge kings.\n\n$^{16}$<mark>How much better to get wisdom than gold! To get understanding is to\nbe chosen rather than silver.</mark> One of the many bits of advice that could\ncome from this would be to prioritise jobs with training and experience over jobs with\nhigher salaries immediately. Especially in your twenties or when you are\nstarting your career. You don't need lots of disposable income, you do need\nwisdom, training, experience, perspective, time with wise or experienced people.\n\n$^{17}$<mark>The highway of the upright turns aside from evil, whoever guards\nhis way preserves his life.</mark> _Guarding your way_ - this is not a concept\nor expression I've heard of before. I guess it could mean \"defend the path your\nlife could take\", or \"think about the consequences (second order consequences).\"\n\n$^{18}$<mark>Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a\nfall.</mark> God really doesn't like pride, and also it leads to destruction.\nThis is not a coincidence. Haughty means \"arrogantly superior or disdainful\"\nwhich is mostly a synonym for prideful.\n\n$^{19}$<mark>It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor than to divide\nthe spoil with the proud.</mark> Avoid prideful people, avoid evil people.\nProverbs seems really clear that you are supposed to socialise and spend time\nwith people you want to be like. A lowly spirit is \"low is status, or humble\".\nBetter to hang out with poor people and be humble than to be rich and associate\nwith prideful people.\n\n$^{20}$<mark>Whoever gives thought to a matter will discover good, and blessed\nis he who trusts in the Lord.</mark> More encouragement to trust God, and to be\nconsiderate.\n\n21 and 23 both say that it is wise to speak persuasively or encouragingly. If\nthe words are well intended, then make them more effective by being\npersuasive.\n\n$^{21}$<mark>The wise of heart is called discerning, and sweetness of speech\nincreases persuasiveness.</mark>\n\n$^{23}$<mark>The heart of the wise makes his speech judicious[ref]Judicious:\nHaving, showing or done with good judgement or sense.[/ref] and adds\npersuasiveness to his lips.</mark>\n\n$^{24}$<mark>Gracious words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and\nhealth to the body.</mark>Our words affect our bodies, and our souls. Gracious\nwords are really valuable. Gracious means to be kind, courteous, or patient. Let\nit go, be gentle.\n\n$^{25}$<mark>There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to\ndeath.</mark> Don't be so confident in your own wisdom and judgement. It's not\njust that your judgement is a bit less good than God's, this proverb says its\ntotally opposite. Expect to be doing things that look like the opposite of what\nsomeone might expect. Expect to do unintuitive things.\n\n$^{26}$<mark>A workers appetite works for him, his mouth urges him on.</mark>\nTrue that.\n\n$^{32}$<mark>Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who\nrules his spirit than he who takes a city.</mark> Wow. This is high praise for\nself control.\n\n![domino meme](/static/images/proverbs/domino-meme.jpg)\n",

      "\n\nContents:\n<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude=\"Overview\" toHeading={2} />\n\n# Context\n\nThese are my notes from reading Proverbs, one of the books in the bible. Almost\nthe entire book is a collection of proverbs - short sayings that are generally\ntrue. I presume there is some structure and themes in their arrangement,\ntaking notes should help these become clearer and hopefully also help me\nremember and apply them better.\n\nThe book is split up into chapters, which are quite short sections of the book.\nIt would probably take about a minute or two to read each one. The chapters are\nfurther split up into verses. In Proverbs each verse seems to be one sentence.\n\nNumbering the text like this is useful because it lets you refer precisely to a\npart of the book. Proverbs does have a few headings, but they are too far apart\nto provide enough structure on their own, I think.\n\nI've read this book a couple of times before, and appreciated it even when I\ncould feel that I was missing most of the wisdom in it. The book is quite easy\nto read - the sentences are short and the analogies seem simple enough.\n\nIt's refreshing to read something that has existed for thousands of year, has\nwithstood criticisms, and feels approachable. It's practical, despite being\nold and written in a completely different cultural context. I find this comforting.\n\n# Notes\n\nEach proverb contrasts justice and injustice using a variety of\nphrases and images. Pride and humility, integrity and crookedness, righteousness\nand wickedness.\n\nIn the context of these qualities, various situations are described: a false\nbalance, disgrace, wisdom, riches.\n\nThe proverbs are somewhat exaggerated, which seems reasonable given that they\nare self contained single sentences tasked with defining and then resolving a\nproblem. The imagery is clear, it does not rely on subtlety.\n\nThe biggest themes are that honesty, integrity, righteousness are to be valued,\nand their opposites are to be avoided at all costs. Each of these qualities are\nin fact actions, not sentiments, and the consequences of these actions are\nreliable and consistent, and inevitable. The advice to \"love your neighbor like\nyourself\" is a good summary of many of the proverbs.\n\nIts clarity and confidence is encouraging. Do good and good things will happen,\ndo evil and the consequences are inevitably bad for you.\n\n# Examples\n\n- <mark>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and whoever captures souls is\n  wise</mark> - _the first part sounds wonderful. Who wouldn't want to produce life?\n  The second part is surprising. What is the \"capturing souls\"?_\n- <mark>The desire of the righteous ends only in good, the expectation of the wicked\n  in wrath.</mark> - _this is encouraging_\n- <mark>One gives freely, yet grows all the richer; another withholds what he should\n  give, and only suffers want.</mark> - _counter-intuitive_\n- <mark>Like a gold ring a pig's snout is a beautiful woman without discretion</mark> - _this\n  doesn't seem to fit in with any proverbs around it. Is this the only mention\n  of a woman in this section? Why is it important enough to be included? Does\n  this imply that beauty is discreet? There is surely a big cultural gap\n  between Amsterdam in 2021 and where ever this was first written._\n- <mark>A man who is kind benefits himself, but a cruel man hurts himself.</mark> - _this is good to know_\n\n# Conclusion\n\n- Don't lie, cheat, steal or plot. Treat people like you yourself would want to be\n  treated.\n- Make an effort to do good and increase justice, and things will go well\n  for you.\n- God delights in blameless people, and he abhors people with crooked\n  hearts.\n- Beauty without discretion is an incongruous waste.\n",

      "\n\nFrom The Psychology of Computer Programming, 1971, here are The Ten\nCommandments of Egoless Programming:\n\n1. Understand and accept that you will make mistakes. The point is to find them\n   early, before they make it into production. Fortunately, except for the few of\n   us developing rocket guidance software at JPL, mistakes are rarely fatal in our\n   industry. We can, and should, learn, laugh, and move on.\n\n2. You are not your code. Remember that the entire point of a review is to find\n   problems, and problems will be found. Don’t take it personally when one is\n   uncovered.\n\n3. No matter how much “karate” you know, someone else will always know more. Such\n   an individual can teach you some new moves if you ask. Seek and accept input\n   from others, especially when you think it’s not needed.\n\n4. Don’t rewrite code without consultation. There’s a fine line between “fixing\n   code” and “rewriting code.” Know the difference, and pursue stylistic changes\n   within the framework of a code review, not as a lone enforcer.\n\n5. Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.\n   Non-technical people who deal with developers on a regular basis almost\n   universally hold the opinion that we are prima donnas at best and crybabies at\n   worst. Don’t reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience.\n\n6. The only constant in the world is change. Be open to it and accept it with a\n   smile. Look at each change to your requirements, platform, or tool as a new\n   challenge, rather than some serious inconvenience to be fought.\n\n7. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position. Knowledge\n   engenders authority, and authority engenders respect – so if you want respect in\n   an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge.\n\n8. Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat. Understand that\n   sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you are right, don’t take\n   revenge or say “I told you so.” Never make your dearly departed idea a martyr or\n   rallying cry.\n\n9. Don’t be “the coder in the corner.” Don’t be the person in the dark office\n   emerging only for soda. The coder in the corner is out of sight, out of touch,\n   and out of control. This person has no voice in an open, collaborative\n   environment. Get involved in conversations, and be a participant in your office\n   community.\n\n10. Critique code instead of people – be kind to the coder, not to the code. As much\n    as possible, make all of your comments positive and oriented to improving the\n    code. Relate comments to local standards, program specs, increased performance,\n    etc.\n\n[source](http://blog.stephenwyattbush.com/2012/04/07/dad-and-the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming)\n",

There is no \"holy grail\". I guess this means that you should use what you're familiar with and what is _boring_ for you.\n- Uses K8s on AWS. He says \"dont fall into the trap of thinking you need to use it too\" - expertise with these tools was learnt over several years fighting fires on the day job.\n- Productive because he used the tools he is most familiar with and he can focus on shipping.\n- Django, Celery, PostgreSQL, Python, AWS, Redis. - same as MoneyBar and PipPip.\n\n# [Boring tech behind a one person SaaS](https://www.listennotes.com/blog/the-boring-technology-behind-a-one-person-23/)\n\n- The tech-stack keeps evolving\n- \"Boring\" means \"what I'm familiar with so that I can focus on the business\"\n- Most of his time is spent talking to people and thinking. He spends 15% of his time on engineering. Probably it was more when he was setting stuff up.\n- The methods described in the post are **definitely not the best way**. _It's just one way of doing engineering in a very specific type of business. It's not the only way._\n- Django, Celery, PostgreSQL, Python, AWS, Redis. - same as MoneyBar and PipPip.\n- Uses Ansible for provisioning machines. - YAML files. Should look into this.\n- \"Good enough for now\"\n- Doesn't use CI tools, he uses Ansible with a shell script he wrote.\n- Uses [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) for monitoring and alerting, and PagerDuty.\n- Uses [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/), which seems similar to Sentry.\n- Uses Slack, not to talk with humans, but integrations with Rollbar and Datadog, and also [slack incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to be notified when someone signs up or does something interesting like deletes a thing.\n- Make a \"ding\" sound whenever someone signs up.\n- He's _always very careful about operational stuff_ to prevent downtime and outages. Servers are over-provisioned to protect against spikes caused by sudden media interest.\n- Avoids working from home or cafe cos its more productive in an office. Productivity is important - make every minute count. He doesn't often work more than 8 hours/day.\n- He optimizes for spending less time and making money instead of more time and saving money.\n- Uses `Vagrant` and `virtualbox` on an MBP so that dev work is on the same systems as prod infra.\n- Uses 1 monolithic repo. Likes this approach.\n- _He uses contractors_!!\n- Usually, the biggest obstacle to building and shipping things is overthinking. What if this, what if that. You are not important at all and no one cares. No one sees. Even if you screw up the initial product launch, no one will care because they're not looking. Only when you've proved that you deserve their attention will you have any attention and visibility.\n- **[Think big, start small, act fast](https://hackernoon.com/think-big-start-small-act-fast-6fdab1f771ea)**.\n- Use boring technology, or whatever tech you want. Just make sure you're solving an actual problem.\n- Ignore the [cargo cult people](https://stevemcconnell.com/articles/cargo-cult-software-engineering/) and ignore the noise. Keep calm and carry on.\n\n# [Django's place in a web development world](https://thenewstack.io/djangos-place-in-a-web-development-world-ruled-by-react/)\n\n- Not everything needs to be an SPA\n- Django is a back-end framework, it'll work with an front-end framework, because separation of concerns.\n- To use Django with an SPA, you could use DRF, or just normal views that return JSON.\n- Reading this makes me want to check out React to see what all the fuss is about.\n\n# <s>[Cache invalidation](https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/cache-invalidation/)</s>\n\n# [Vim abbreviations](https://jovica.org/posts/vim_abbreviations/)\n\n- Cool and all, but not as powerful as snippets I think.\n- Auto correcting typos: teh -> the\n- Expanding phrases: kr -> kind regards\n- Multi-line text expansion.\n- It really seems similar to what I'm using UltiSnips for.\n- I found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30266587/snippets-vs-abbreviations-in-vim) question on SO comparing abbreviations and snippets. TLDR: It's easier to add and maintain snippets than abbreviations, and you have less boilerplate with snippets than abbreviations, especially in complex cases.\n\n# <s>[To fix the social sciences, look to the “dark ages” of medicine](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/social-sciences-dark-ages/)</s>\n\n# [Emotional resilience in leadership report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FfZ86PGA_uSFf425EzKXAmiFQLFBPqjqPN7iu1TZRw/preview?pru=AAABdEZGCv8*_gdPBrQH8tAPyvMfLk6Unw)\n\n# [3 virtues of a programmer](http://threevirtues.com/)\n\n- Laziness - The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure.

This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.\n- Hubris - The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.\n- Also, I read a quote somewhere saying the mark of a great program is having people use it in ways you didn't expect, or something like that.\n\n# [Is WebAssembly magic performance pixie dust?](https://surma.dev/things/js-to-asc/)\n\n# [Yamauchi No.10 Family Office](https://y-n10.com/)\n\n- A beautifully designed website.\n\n# [Improve and Extend Your Text Objects With targets.vim](https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/blog/exploring-vim-plugins-improve-and-extend-your-text-objects-with-targets-vim)\n\n# [A Vim Guide for Adept Users](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-adept)\n\n- How to manipulate multiple quickfix and location lists.\n- What are digraphs and how to use them.\n- Useful keystrokes in INSERT mode.\n- Useful keystrokes in VISUAL mode.\n- Vim regular expressions.\n- Using shell commands in Vim.\n- Folding content.\n\n# [Deep dive in CORS](https://ieftimov.com/post/deep-dive-cors-history-how-it-works-best-practices/)\n\n# [The TTY demystified](http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/index.php)\n\n- `ps 1` - see which processes are running or sleeping. `WCHAN` tells you which\n  kernel event a waiting processing is awaiting.\n",

The data volume needs to point to `/polkadot/.local/share`. The symlink that\n    is supposed to exist for `/data` appears to be broken in the current image.\n    See this GitHub [issue](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/2482) for details.\n\n2.

Whilst it is\n    still syncing it will only return the current highest block when you make\n    the initial API call. I ended up chatting to one of the Parity devs about\n    this issue on discord and then on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66358685/polkadot-websocket-api-doesnt-listen-for-new-blocks/66365716?noredirect=1#comment117342945_66365716).\n\nOther than that, everything went as described in the documentation.\n",

      "\n\n## Background\n\nFrom Spring 2010 until the Autumn of 2013, I was a PhD candidate living\nin Vienna, Austria and working at the University of Natural Resources\nand Life Sciences. Before working in Vienna, I completed my Masters\ndegree in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of\nEdinburgh.\n\nMy research quantified the effects of changing the amount of gravity\nacting on granular materials as they poured out of a silo. My [thesis](/documents/Mathews_J_2013_thesis.pdf) and the short\n[presentation](/documents/Mathews_J_2013_Defence_presentation.pdf) I\nused to defend it are available.\n\n![4 silos](/static/images/silos1/4_silos.jpeg)\n\n![granular materials](/static/images/silos1/granular_materials.jpeg)\n\nGranular materials are a broad class of materials that are\nencountered everyday - salt, pills, breakfast cereal, sand, rice, soil,\nlandslides are all granular materials. They are ubiquitous and occur in\nmany different sizes and varieties.\n\nSilos are a common type of container for storing granular materials. You\npour the granular material in from the top, store it for a while, and\nthen dispense the material in controlled quantities from the bottom.\n\n## Research focus\n\nMy research focussed on quantifying how changes in gravity affected the\nmaterial contained inside a silo, particularly whilst the silo was being\nemptied. This is pertinent because engineers and scientists do not yet\nhave a scientific understanding of how granular materials behave. Whilst\ngravity clearly affects a granular materials, we cannot say exactly how.\n\nThis means we can't use analytical methods to quantify the physics that\noccur in a real system. Instead we use empirical methods\n(approximations, guesses, rules-of-thumb, and knowledge of what worked\nin previous similar situations). This isn't necessarily bad, but it is\nless efficient and less reliable than an analytical approach.\n\n## Research techniques\n\n### Physical modelling\n\nI built a small model silo (30cm tall) and put it into quite a large centrifuge\n(3 metre diameter). By rotating the model silo around the centre of the\ncentrifuge at a constant speed I could simulate a higher gravity. I added\nhigh-speed cameras, pressure sensors and weighing scales so that I could\nmeasure how the material was moving once I opened the silo outlet and the silo\nbegan to empty. Photos of the experimental model I built can be seen below.\n\n### Numerical modelling\n\nI also programmed a computer model (using the commercial PFC 3D software and\nworking in the FISH scripting language) to simulate and investigate if the same\nbehaviours could be observed numerically as physically.\n\nThe class of computer model I used is known as DEM (Discrete Element\nModelling). These models work by considering every grain of material\nindividually, usually as a sphere. If one sphere overlaps with another (i.e.\nthe distance between the two particle centres is less than the sum of their\nradiuses) then a force proportional to the overlap size repels the two spheres\naway from each other. This simple approach is repeated over every grain or\nparticle in the model, and produces life like behaviour in many situations. It\nhas many advantages over \"continuum\" based techniques that model groups of\ngrains as if they were all just one big particle with unusual properties. DEM\nhas one massive limitation, though. It requires huge amounts of computational\nresources - and this limits its use in industrial scenarios outside. Until\ncomputers become much, much more powerful, DEM will only be used for\ntheoretical research and niche applications.\n\n## Results\n\nWhen gravity increases by a factor of $x$, both the discharge rate and local\nvelocities within the silo increase by $\\sqrt(x)$ .\n\nThat's good to know if you're planning on storing stuff on the moon, but it's\nalso a useful step towards explaining exactly why bulk granular materials\nbehave the way they do.\n\n## More Information\n\nAn overview of my research, my doctorate thesis and published papers can\nbe downloaded below.

      "\n\nThis is a copy of a great article on [medium](https://alexewerlof.medium.com/my-guiding-principles-after-20-years-of-programming-a087dc55596c) by Alex Ewerloef.\n\nI've copied it here because an article on Medium could disappear at any moment,\nand its too good to lose:\n\n---\n\nI’ve been programming since 1999 and this year I’ve officially coded for 20+\nyears. I started with Basic but soon jumped into Pascal and C and then learned\nobject oriented programming (OOP) with Delphi and C++. In 2006 I started with\nJava and in 2011 I started with JavaScript. I’ve worked with a wide range of\nbusinesses from robotics, fin tech, med tech to media and telecom. Sometimes I\nhad a different hat as a researcher, CTO, TPM (technical product manager),\nteacher, system architect or TL (technical leader) but I’ve always been coding.\nI’ve worked on some products that served millions of people, and some that\nfailed before being released. I worked as a consultant and I even had my own\nstartup. I have spent lots of time on open source projects, closed source\nprojects and internally open source projects (proprietary code that is developed\nby a community inside the company). I’ve worked with tiny microcontrollers all\nthe way to mobile and desktop apps to cloud servers and lately serverless.\n\nFor my 20 years programming anniversary, I tried to list the top principles that\nhave been accumulated over the years as my guiding principles through my career:\n\n1.  Don’t fight the tools: libraries, language, platform, etc. Use as much native\n    constructs as possible. Don’t bend the technology, but don’t bend the problem\n    either. Pick the right tool for the job or you’ll have to find the right job for\n    the tool you got.\n\n1.  You don’t write the code for the machines, you write it for your colleagues\n    and your future self (unless it’s a throw away project or you’re writing\n    assembly). Write it for the junior ones as a reference.\n\n1.  Any significant and rewarding piece of software is the result of\n    collaboration. Communicate effectively and collaborate openly. Trust others and\n    earn their trust. Respect people more than code. Lead by example. Convert your\n    followers to leaders.\n\n1.  Divide and conquer. Write isolated modules with separate concerns which are\n    loosely coupled. Test each part separately and together. Keep the tests close to\n    reality but test the edge cases too.\n\n1.  Deprecate yourself. Don’t be the go-to person for the code. Optimize it for\n    people to find their way fixing bugs and adding features to the code. Free\n    yourself to move on to the next project/company. Don’t own the code or you’ll\n    never grow beyond that.\n\n1.  Security comes in layers: each layer needs to be assessed individually but\n    also in relation to the whole. Risk is a business decision and has direct\n    relation to vulnerability and probability. Each product/organization has a\n    different risk appetite (the risk they are willing to take for a bigger win).\n    Often these 3 concerns fight with each other: UX, Security, Performance.\n\n1.  Realize that every code has a life cycle and will die. Sometimes it dies in its\n    infancy before seeing the light of production. Be OK with letting go. Know the\n    difference between 4 categories of features and where to put your time and\n    energy:\n\n        - Core: like an engine in a car. The product is meaningless without it.\n        - Necessary: like a car’s spare wheel. It’s rarely used but when needed, its function decides the success of the system.\n        - Added value: like a car’s cup-holder. It’s nice to have but the product is perfectly usable without it.\n        - Unique Selling Point: the main reason people should buy your product instead of your rivals. For example, your car is the best off-road vehicle.\n\n1.  Don’t attach your identity to your code. Don’t attach anyone’s identity to\n    their code. Realize that people are separate from the artifacts they produce.\n    Don’t take code criticism personally but be very careful when criticizing\n    others’ code.\n\n1.  Tech debt is like fast food. Occasionally it’s acceptable but if you get used\n    to it, it’ll kill the product faster than you think (and in a painful way).\n\n1.  When making decisions about the solution all things equal, go for this\n    priority:\n\n1.  Security > Reliability > Usability (Accessibility & UX) > Maintainability > Simplicity (Developer experience/DX) > Brevity (code length) > Finance >\n    Performance\n\n1.  But don’t follow that blindly because it is dependent on the nature of the\n    product. Like any career, the more experience you earn, the more you can find\n    the right balance for each given situation. For example, when designing a game\n    engine, performance has the highest priority, but when creating a banking app,\n    security is the most important factor.\n\n1.  Bugs’ genitals are called copy & paste. That’s how they reproduce. Always\n    read what you copy, always audit what you import. Bugs take shelter in\n    complexity. “Magic” is fine in my dependency but not in my code.\n\n1.  Don’t only write code for the happy scenario. Write good errors that answer\n    why it happened, how it was detected and what can be done to resolve it.\n    Validate all system input (including user input): fail early but recover from\n    errors whenever possible. Assume the user holds a gun: put enough effort into\n    your errors to convince them to shoot something other than your head!\n\n1.  Don’t use dependencies unless the cost of importing, maintaining, dealing\n    with their edge cases/bugs and refactoring when they don’t satisfy the needs is\n    significantly less than the code that you own.\n\n1.  Stay clear from hype-driven development. But learn all you can. Always have\n    pet projects.\n\n1.  Get out of your comfort zone. Learn every day. Teach what you learn. If\n    you’re the master, you’re not learning. Expose yourself to other languages,\n    technologies, culture and stay curious.\n\n1.  Good code doesn’t need documentation, great code is well documented so that\n    anyone who hasn’t been part of the evolution, trial & error process and\n    requirements that led to the current status can be productive with it. An\n    undocumented feature is a non-existing feature. A non-existing feature shouldn’t\n    have code.\n\n1.  Avoid overriding, inheritance and implicit smartness as much as possible.\n    Write pure functions. They are easier to test and reason about. Any function\n    that’s not pure should be a class. Any code construct that has a different\n    function, should have a different name.\n\n1.  Never start coding (making a solution) unless you fully understand the\n    problem. It’s very normal to spend more time listening and reading than typing\n    code. Understand the domain before starting to code. A problem is like a maze.\n    You need to progressively go through the code-test-improve cycle and explore the\n    problem space till you reach the end.\n\n1.  Don’t solve a problem that doesn’t exist. Don’t do speculative programming.\n    Only make the code extensible if it is a validated assumption that it’ll be\n    extended. Chances are by the time it gets extended, the problem definition looks\n    different from when you wrote the code. Don’t overengineer: focus on solving the\n    problem at hand and an effective solution implemented in an efficient manner.\n\n1.  Software is more fun when it’s made together. Build a sustainable community.\n    Listen. Inspire. Learn. Share.\n\nI don’t claim to be an authority in software development. These are just the wisdom I earned along the way. I’m sure this list will be more mature after another 20 years.\n",

      "\n\nimport IframeEmbed from '../components/IframeEmbed'\n\nThis is a list of interests I want to consider pursuing. I wrote it when I began to study for my last set of exams and my mind filled with things I'd rather be doing instead. Some of these interests are just me reacting to having no spare time for a few months, but others are decent goals and projects. Temporarily losing my spare time made me value it more.\n\n![free-time](/images/spare_time.jpg)\n\nI wrote this post so that I could compare what I thought was important when I was busy to when I wasn't. Writing the list allowed me to move on without forgetting. Here's a break down of each item:\n\n1.  \"Run 10k in 50 minutes\" - This is easier than I imagined. When I wrote the\n    list I could barely run 2k without stopping, but intended to go for a\n    weekly run whilst studying. I've struggled to stay energetic and healthy\n    during previous exam phases, so now I have a rule that I must do some mild\n    exercise even if I think I can't spare the time. I find running really\n    lowers my stress levels, and increasing my heart rate and working up a\n    sweat lets me sleep better and concentrate for longer. After a few weeks of\n    minimal running, I could run 5k easily. If I kept at it, 10k in 50 mins\n    would be easy. But point 2...\n\n2.  \"Be Insanity strong\" - As in, do the Insanity workout programme. Again. I thought about it and decided to do P90x instead. Week 1 is going great.\n\n3.  \"Read the bible habitually\" - When I was 17 I found out about Jesus and\n    became a Christian. In the months and years after that I'd regularly read my\n    bible almost every day and pray a lot. I wanted to understand, so I set a\n    goal of 5 chapters each day.\n\n    I read through the new testament repeatedly and read most of the old\n    testament during this time. I knew the scriptures well enough that a lot of\n    sermons became boring and obvious - I'd already studied the bible passage\n    being used. During this time I remember being aware that the way I thought\n    was different to how it would have been otherwise. My perspectives were\n    long-term and less me focused. I thought about what I was reading instead\n    of the days' headlines or social chatter. I remember enjoying the benefits\n    and thinking that I should keep this habit. The reasons why I think\n    Christianity is so wonderful are well summarised in [this\n    sermon](http://messages.destinyedinburgh.com/sermon/the-gospel-we-preach-a-message-for-leaders).\n\n    It's now 10 years later, and whilst my convictions are strong, my knowledge\n    of the bible is sadly pretty fuzzy. My thinking is clouded by the\n    perspectives contained in the media I consume and the conversations I'm\n    part of. I strongly suspect I would be acting and thinking differently if I\n    read my bible more, but I don't know what those differences would be.\n    Trouble is, it's often not obvious what the immediate benefits of\n    reading the bible are, you have to work for it a bit. Praying for help is\n    effective. The books in the bible were written to last through the ages and\n    across all cultures, so it's not surprising that they're not as easy to\n    read as something written for an English speaker in a hurry. I should stop\n    being in a hurry, and stop prioritising only quantifiable goals.\n\n4.  \"Think more\" - On a similar note to 3, but less supernatural. If I spent\n    less time consuming content and a little more looking around me or walking,\n    I reckon I'd be more self-aware and make better decisions. This would\n    probably lead to a happier, more satisfying life.\n\n5.  \"Pray more\" - I don't know why, but the creator of the universe wants me to\n    talk and share my life with him. He cares about me. This makes no sense to\n    me, at all. If I was God, I would not go out of my way to consider the views\n    and concerns of a very flawed human. But when I pray, my prayers are very\n    often answered. I should ask him about this.\n\n6.  \"Amazon seller?\" - Amazon have this \"Fulfilled by Amazon\" service,\n    which means you don't even need to hold the stock you want to sell.\n    If I choose the right products, import them cheaply from China and\n    reselling  them on Amazon at a profit, I end up quids in for minimal\n    effort and manageable risk. Sounds intriguing.\n\n7.  \"Blog about interesting data\" - Here I am, blogging. I should stick\n    to the main topic and get technical. I was inspired by this\n    [blog](http://www.curiousgnu.com/) in particular.\n\n8.  \"Finish Coursera\" - The data science specialization is great! It's in R, and I want to focus on Python, but I'd still like to do it. I need to consider the opportunity cost of the time committed, though.\n\n9.  \"Read for fun, history, fiction\" - When I started my job, in April 2014, I\n    was half way through [Savage\n    Continent](https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B00796LLLK&asin=B00796LLLK&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_GP2Rxb3Q8MYC4),\n    which is an eye-opening and eye-watering history of Europe in the years\n    after World War 2. I see Europe through different eyes because of it.\n    However I only got half way though, and since April '14 I never felt I had\n    the free time or energy to pick it back up. This should change. When I was a\n    researcher, and when I was a student, I had so much more opportunity to\n    develop my own pursuits. Since entering the corporate world, I find myself\n    fighting a war of attrition to exert my personality onto my lifestyle.\n\n    Read for fiction... I'm unconvinced. What do you have at the end of\n    it? What can you do with it? Maybe I've just been reading the wrong authors,\n    but I'm going to leave this for now. Sure, you could gain an appreciation of\n    a different time or place, but that appreciation comes via the fictional\n    characters and events, its secondary. What about abstract constructs,\n    perspectives, morals... things that history books are ill-suited for? Great\n    fiction would be essential for exploring these. But for now, I'll prioritise\n    point 3.\n\n    <IframeEmbed src='https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/card?asin=B00796LLLK&amp;asin=B00796LLLK&amp;preview=inline&amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_GP2Rxb3Q8MYC4' />\n\n10. \"Do a photography project\" - This I would love to do, but probably won't.\n    It would be a luxury, and the opportunity cost would be too great right\n    now. I'd like to shoot a series of black and white portraits, and turn them\n    into large prints. I think good portrait photography is uniquely impactful\n    and moving, choosing B&W removes distractions and leaves a subjects\n    humanity more exposed.\n\n11. \"Have a list of business/product ideas\" - There's no excuse for this\n    one, anyone can have several good ideas. It's turning them into\n    reality that takes skill. Need to have the ideas first, though.\n\n12. \"Do a law MOOC\" - i.e Study particular areas of law, in my own time\n    and at my own pace. I studied a tiny bit of law during the ACA, and\n    realised employment law or contract law could be really useful.\n    (Same for the tax system - another surprise). We only had a brief\n    introduction though, so if I could find the time I'd like to know\n    more.\n\n13. \"Do an InfoSec or Network Security MOOC\" - Its super interesting,\n    but not likely to be a good use of time.\n\n14. \"Learn to fight - Krav Maga / MMA\" - Ever since watching The Bourne\n    Identity I've wanted to learn Krav Maga, and [Georges\n    St-Pierre](https://youtu.be/LybrzdG96_8) made me want to train\n    for MMA. For now though, I'll do P90x. I can reconsider in 90 days.\n\n    <IframeEmbed src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/u0_8dzaNxhg' />\n\n15. \"Get out of London\" - My contract ends in April 2017, next summer\n    will be a crossroads. I hate the commute, I hate being constantly\n    rushed. Living in other cities has been a lot more pleasant.\n",

If it\'s your server, it goes in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This file contains a list of authorized public keys, one per line.\n\n## Setup `SSH-Agent` to prevent passphrase prompt\n\n- Ensure that `ssh-agent` is running `eval $(ssh-agent -s)`\n- Ensure that the following is in `~/.ssh/config`:\n\n```apache\n    Host *\n     AddKeysToAgent yes\n     UseKeychain yes\n     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n\n- Add the private key to your local ssh-agent `/usr/bin/ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Use the full path to ensure that the Apple version of the command is used.\n\n# Authentication\n\n## Passwords and Keys\n\n1. There are three authentication methods:\n\n   1. Keys - very secure.\n   1. Passwords - less secure than keys.\n   1. IP white lists - connect without authentication by specifying a particular IP address, I think. Presumably via some VPN or proxy.\n\n2. Passwords are encrypted. They are conceptually familiar but can and will\n   be brute forced. There are tools that will block repeated attempts (e.g. fail2ban) or\n   block/allow authentication attempts from particular IP addresses.\n\n3. SSH keys using public and private (or secret) key pairs and are very secure.\n   Keys are generated in pairs.\n\n   - The public key can be shared freely without concern.\n   - The secret key must be kept as secure and secret as a password.\n\n4. To authenticate using a key pair:\n\n   - The client must have both keys (a key pair) on their computer.\n   - The server must have the public key in a file called `authorized_keys`.\n   - If the server has the private key then something has gone wrong and you should generate new keys and delete the compromised key.\n\n5. The server stores the public keys of users who can connect as a particular\n   user in the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This file contains a list of\n   public keys, one public key on each row.\n\n## Handshake\n\n1. When a client wants to connect to a server using SSH, it tells the server\n   which public key to use. The server then checks in the `authorized_keys` file\n   for the public key.\n\n2. A unique session ID is generated and shared between the client and server.\n\n3. If the server has the same public key that the client sent when it began\n   the connection attempt, the server generates a random string and encrypts\n   it using the public key. This random string can only be decrypted using the\n   private (secret) key associated with the public key.\n\n4. The server sends the encrypted string to the client. The client decrypts it\n   using the secret key and combines the original random string with the\n   session ID. The client then hashes the combined string and sends the hash\n   back to the server.\n\n5. The server already has the hash of the string combining the original random\n   string and the session ID. If the hash from the client matches the hash on\n   the server, the server can be sure that the client has the private key.\n\n# Background\n\n1. Secure Shell lets you securely connect to remote servers. You connect using\n   an account that exists on the remote server. Once you\'ve connected you\'ll be\n   dropped into a shell session.\n\n2. The computer you connect from is the "local" or "client" computer. The\n   computer you connect to is the "host" or the "server".\n\n3. When you\'re connected to the server using SSH, any commands you input from\n   the client are sent securely and privately through a _tunnel_ to the remote\n   computer, where the commands are executed.\n\n4. SSH is implemented using the client-server model. The server must be running\n   a small app to listen for SSH connections. This kind of app is\n   called a daemon (_day-mon_). For SSH to work, the host must be\n   running the SSH daemon. The SSH daemon listens for connections on a specific\n   port (22), authenticates connections requests, and (if the connection\n   request is approved) it will spawn the correct environment. The correct\n   environment is a terminal session.\n\n5. The client (the computer you connect from) must be running an SSH client,\n   which is a small app that can communicate using the SSH protocol. (A\n   protocol is a set of rules.) It needs to be able to receive information\n   about which host to connect to, which user to connect as and which\n   credentials to use when trying to connect.\n\n# Source\n\n[article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys)\n',

      "\n\nTest Driven Development was mind-bending when I first grappled with it:\n\n- \"Write a test for the code before you write the code\"\n- \"Assert that your code matches your expectations by understanding _all_ the inputs and _all_ the outputs for _every_ function or method I write\".\n\nLast summer I was building a web app and began to break things unintentionally\nwhen adding new features. This soon led to lots of clicking around different\npages to test if stuff was still working each time I made an update.\n\nThis led to me thinking there must be a better way, which eventually brought\nme to Test Driven Development (TDD).\n\nIt should have just led me to writing tests, which it did. But googling\nwhatever I googled got me down the TDD rabbit hole rather than just the \"write\nsome tests\" rabbit hole. Write tests for your code before you write the code.\nWrite tests for bugs you've fixed to check they stay fixed. Write tests as a\nkind of documentation to show what stuff is supposed to be doing. Errr...\n\nDjango was a big enough pile of abstractions as it was. Views, ORMs, mixins,\nserializers... Trying to add factories and fixtures into that took some getting\nused to. But eventually I made some progress, and now I quite enjoy running\ncoverage reports to keep coverage _close_ to 100%[ref]Which is fun and all, but\ntesting for the sake of it doesn't necessarily stop bad things happening. Its very possible to write a test that covers the code you've just\nwritten without ensuring that _only_ the intended behaviours happen.[/ref].\n\nSome of the main things I've learnt about writing tests:\n\n1. Use PyTest as much as possible rather than other testing libraries - its `assert` statements are more intuitive than Django's own testing framework, and you can use it in any Python codebase, not just Django. It has lots of extensions and seems good at getting the job done fairly easily.\n2. Write tests as you go. I haven't (yet) reached the elevated level of writing\n   tests before I write the code to be tested, though I see why that would\n   sometimes be useful. I do think writing tests sooner rather than later is\n   best though, ideally as soon as you've got a basic version of your feature working.\n3. Use `Coverage` to show you which code is covered by your tests, and which\n   branches or edge cases are not. But be warned, it doesn't tell you if the\n   test is useful or not, only that it passes and which methods or functions it\n   uses.\n4. Fixtures are great for keeping tests fairly DRY. `Freezegun` is great for\n   testing anything to do with dates and times.\n5. Static type checkers, like `Mypy`, get more attractive in proportion to\n   codebase complexity and size.\n",

    content:
      "\n\nIn a [previous post](time-since) I described how I was introduced to CoffeeScript via [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/), the desktop widget app for OS X, and eventually published the \"[Time Since](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#time_since)\" widget.\n\nSeeing a few people download the widget was really satisfying, and I was soon wondering what else I could publish. As a pragmatic engineer, it seemed clear to me what the next widget should do: If my first widget calculated the time since an event, the next should calculate the time until an event. I set out to create the companion to \"Time Since\" and\nimprove upon the underlying code.\n\nMy first code design choice was to cut out the use of an Apple Script and calculated everything in one CoffeeScript file. It would be more efficient and easier to read.\n\nUnfortunately I soon began to realise why the original widget I'd based \"Time Since\" on had used AppleScript to calculate the time elapsed. Date-Times are fiddly to work with in many languages, and this is true in JavaScript also.\n\nMy code began to look increasingly like spaghetti as I tried to achieve 6 key features:\n\n1.  Calculate the number of months and days between two dates\n    (complicated by the varying number of days in different months)\n2.  Add the option to specify the level of detail in the output text (to\n    the minute, to the hour, to the day, etc.)\n3.  Remove any 0 amounts from the output (\"2 Months and 5 Hours\" not \"2\n    Months, 0 Days and 5 Hours\")\n4.  Add the option to abbreviate times ('years' → 'y', 'hours' → 'h',\n    'and' → '&', etc.)\n5.  Output a grammatically correct sentence (correct pluralisation and\n    comma separated terms, with an \"and\" between the last two terms)\n6.  Prepend and append users defined strings\n\nAfter a few frustrating hours, it was clear that it would be a lot easier to modify the existing AppleScript rather than reinvent the wheel in JavaScript. I decided to use it instead of using only JavaScript as I knew the AppleScript file could correctly consider the number of days in\nthe months between the 2 dates (feature 1), and it contains a function to pluralise the correct parts of the string (feature 5).\n\nThe remaining features were added by using a combination of if statements and arrays. The if statements simply ask if an amount is equal to zero. If not, then it's appended to an array of terms to include in the output. At the end of this code chunk it's possible to ask how many non-zero terms to include in the output. An array with length one less than the number of output terms is created and filled with commas with an 'and' in the final position.\n\nThe two arrays are combined in the correct order by looping through the index of the longer array and appending each term to a final array. The final array is the output.\n\n_'[Time Until](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#time_until)'_ can be downloaded from the [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) [widgets gallery](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/). I think another useful feature would be an option to specify the output only in terms of a chosen amount, such as weeks or days. Maybe I'll do that in the future.\n",

      "\n\nI've been feeling very comfortable with my Vim + Tmux setup recently.\nNavigating around shells and files isn't taking much mental effort anymore.\nWohoo!\n\nIt's taken about 2 years of working full time with vim to get to the stage\nwhere the commands are so intuitive that:\n\n1.  I pepper text files outside of vim (email, notes, etc) with vim keys\n    accidentally - `j` `k` `x` etc\n\n2.  I can't remember what the command is to do something if I'm not actually\n    doing it. When I need to do an action, I do it from muscle\n    memory and I only pay attention to the underlying key press if something\n    goes wrong.\n\n    This is noticeable when trying to find an unbound key combination for some\n    new action, or when reading an article about vim and thinking \"that's new\"\n    when actually I've been doing it without noticing.\n\n3.  A pleasant surprise has been that it doesn't take much effort to\n    rebind a single command and retrain myself to use it. This is presumably\n    because the mental effort for all the other commands has become negligible.\n    In the early days, retraining a key combination took a lot more effort\n    because I was already making an effort to get used to doing things in Vim.\n\n4.  I can work even when my vision is blurry (and my speech slurred and my head\n    heavy) because I can use text objects and navigation commands to get to\n    where I know text is. I'm not saying I _should_ work when I'm that tired,\n    but I can, if I'm already familiar with the code/file..\n",

Using git to push to an origin and then pull from the other\nside wasn't simple enough.\n\nUnison can power the synrconization, but I wanted some nice convenient way to\nrun the syncronization steps for an entire project, even if I were in a\nsubdirectory.

The project root is the same as the git root. The git project root can be found using: `localProjectRoot=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`\n1.

      "\n\n### Updated: 10 Feb 2021\n\nI found a [blog post](https://brandur.org/fragments/rss-abandon) which is\nsurprisingly similar to my thoughts on RSS feeds, but better presented and\nthought through. The post mentions the idea that \"RSS is about capturing the\nlong tail of blogs that don't post frequently\"\n[ref][https://marco.org/2013/03/26/power-of-rss](https://marco.org/2013/03/26/power-of-rss)[/ref].\n\nThis idea crystalised why I was so glad I'd started using RSS feeds\nagain. If readers use RSS, then authors don't need to concern themselves with\nattention. This removes pressure on the author to post\nfrequently and lets them focus on quality over quantity. News feeds and ad\nsupported platforms have fundamentally different mechanics and incentives.\n\nWith RSS I can let good quality content come to me, on its own schedule. I\ndon't need to remember to look for it, and the authors don't need to remind me\nthat they exist.\n\n## Google Reader\n\nRSS is a very effective way of having good quality information\ncome to you. Back in 2008, I used to use Google Reader to subscribe to RSS\nfeeds. I was an aspiring photographer back then and I remember being subscribed\nto around 80 blogs. Each day I'd read articles from whoever had posted\nsomething new, without needing to visit their websites or remember who they are\nor that I'd subscribed to their blog. The authors didn't need to optimize their\noutput according to an opaque and changing algorithm either - they didn't need\nto optimize article length, tags, post frequency, image inclusion or linked\ncontent. They could write how they wanted to, which I suspect leads to higher\nquality content.\n\n## Social Media\n\nA few years later Google Reader was closed down, presumably because using RSS\ndidn't fit with Googles advertising model. I was unaware of it at the time but\nI imagine it sent shockwaves through blogging communities and probably upended\nmany businesses. I mostly stopped reading blogs.\n\nFacebook was growing fast, Instagram felt new and exciting, and content was\nmoving onto 'platforms', or into walled gardens. And as they kept on growing\nthe average quality of the content decreased.\n\nTwitter is like this now I think. There are some real diamonds to be found from\ntime to time, but there's a lot of mud too. Mostly its just mud, but the\noccasional diamond can have outsized benefits.\n\nRSS isn't like this. I choose the contents of my 'news feed', and\neach article can be much longer than a Tweet, or a caption to a photo, or a\nstatus update. It's hard to write well and to create an interesting or useful blog\npost, and that makes it harder to dilute quality with entertaining\ndistractions. I have complete control about what content I see, and I can\nchange it whenever I want. The process is designed around me.\n\n## Reeder5\n\nI used `netNewsWire` for a few weeks, but it couldn't sync between my laptop\nand phone, so I bought `Reeder 5`. It's got a few unusual design patterns, but\nit works well and has all the features I want. I've been unsubscribing from\nemail newsletters and subscribing to the RSS feed instead.\n\nIt keeps my inbox quieter, and it feels good to have a 'separation of\nconcerns'. It makes it easier to read interesting content without being\ndistracted.\n",

    category: "Technical/Developer Tools",
    content:
      "\n\nAs part of the redesign of this blog I wanted to make an article's category more meaningful. Previously, I simply picked a handful of categories and then assigned a single category to each post. This method becomes limiting when an article is relevant to multiple categories.\n\nAlso, using nested categories seems like a good way of grouping similar content and allowing more nuanced filtering of interests.\n\nAs I considered how to update the categories of existing articles, I realised this would be a good opportunity to practice analyzing and updating text files using unix utilities.\n\nHere is how I reviewed and updated the categories of my existing articles:\n\nI use Pelican to generate the static files for this site. It converts markdown into HTML. Metadata for each article is set at the beginning of a file, the title is set by typing `Title: ...` and similarly the category is set by typing `Category: ...` on its own line.\n\nTo locate, analyse and update my existing categories, I would therefore need to\nfind all the markdown files which have a row that begins with `Category: `\n\n- `grep -h ‘Category:’ **/*.md` - prints each search result.\n- `grep -h ‘Category:’ **/*.md | sort` - prints and sorts each search result.\n- `grep -h ‘Category:’ **/*.md | sort | uniq -c` prints and sorts each search\n  result, then counts how many occurrences of each unique result there are.\n\nI had some repeat results though because some rows had white space at the end,\nso in order to make these the same, I needed to remove trailing whitespace:\n\n- `grep -h 'Category:' **/*.md | sed 's/[[:space:]]//g' | sort | uniq -c`\n\nThis gave me the following results:\n\n```shell\n6 Category:\n2 Category:Data\n16 Category:Disintermediation\n2 Category:Engineering\n2 Category:Front-end\n15 Category:General\n15 Category:Startups\n8 Category:Tools\n```\n\nCategory is repeated and isn't needed:\n\n- `grep -h 'Category:' **/*.md | sed 's/[[:space:]]//g' | sort | uniq -c | sort | sed 's/Category://g'`\n\nThis gives me the following output, which is acceptable:\n\n```shell\n2 Data\n2 Engineering\n2 Front-end\n6\n8 Tools\n15 General\n15 Startups\n16 Disintermediation\n```\n\n## New Categories\n\nThe next stage was to begin updating these categories with the new, nested\ncategories. I've decided to try splitting the categories into technical and\nnon-technical groups.\n\nI can imagine splitting `Technical > Data` even more in\nfuture, perhaps having `Data Analytics`, `Data Science`, and `Data Engineering` as\nsub categories.\n\n- Technical\n  - Data\n  - Developer Tools\n  - Web\n  - Cryptocurrency\n  - Civil Engineering\n- Not technical\n  - Entrepreneurship\n  - Family\n  - Self\n  - Career\n\nI `cd` into the directory containing the markdown files, and then to change\nall the articles with `Category: Tools` to `Category: Technical/Developer Tools` I did:\n\n- `grep -l 'Category: Tools' *.md | xargs sed -i 's/Category: Tools/Category: Technical\\/Developer Tools/g'`\n\nIf I want to see a list of files containing `Category: General`:\n\n- `grep -H 'Category: General' *.md`\n\nIf I want to see just the file names, then:\n\n- `grep -l 'Category: General' *.md`\n\n# Update\n\nSince writing this post I've modified the categories a few times. The commands I\nrun to switch out categories are as follows:\n\n```sh\nexport oldName=Lifestyle; export newName=Living\ngrep -l \"Category: .*Non-technical/$oldName\" content/articles/*.md | xargs sed -i '' \"s/Non-technical\\/$oldName/Non-technical\\/$newName/g\"\n```\n\nNotes:\n\n- Double quotes are not the same as single quotes. You need to use them if you\n  want to access variables or commands inside a string.\n- `.*` is a wildcard operator allowing any number of characters. It's\n  required when an article belongs to multiple categories.\n",

      "\n\nContents:\n<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude=\"Overview\" toHeading={2} />\n\n## A mystery\n\nCloudFlare give me two different measures of how many people have\nvisited my website, one using their Analytics product and other from their new\nWeb Analytics product. I get very different results for page views and number of\nvisitors. I also get a third distinct set of results from my own [analytics tool](analytics).\n\n## Possible Reasons\n\nThe reasons for this don't seem to be explained anywhere obvious, but I think it\ncould be caused by ad blockers preventing the JavaScript used for the Web\nAnalytics product. The normal, (not Web) Analytics product might derive its\nresults from server side events, which would catch everything including bots and\nRSS clients, and be unaffected by ad blockers.\n\nMost of my visitors read the technical articles and therefore the audience is\nprobably very technical and likely to be using an ad blocker. If this is the\ncase then one way to test my hypothesis would be to write some articles that\nappeal to a non-technical audience who are less likely to use an ad blocker. In\nthis case I would expect the two analytics methods to agree more closely.\n\n## Comparison\n\nI made some screen shots at 11pm on June 29$^{th}$ and compared the results from\nthe CloudFlare [Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/analytics/), CloudFlare [Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/), and my own [analytics\ntool]({filename}/pages/website-analytics.md).\n\nCloudFlare's (normal) analytics say I've had 234 unique visitors. But their Web\nAnalytics tool says I've had 11 visitors. My own tool reports 12 unique visitors.\n\nWhy are these results so different? Maybe one measure might be including bots\nand another might only be trying to report real people using normal browsers,\nbut the difference seems too high for that.[ref]CloudFlare do tell me they've\nblocked 199 attacks in the last month, but I don't think this explains the\ndifference.[/ref] I'd also expect real usage to fall when its night in the\ncountries I get most traffic from, which I don't see. Perhaps the difference is\ncaused by 95% of my readers are using an ad blocker.\n\nMy own analytics [tool]({filename}/pages/website-analytics.md) can't give results\nfrom a rolling 24 hour window, it only groups data by day. Therefore I recorded\nthe values at 11pm, which should be close enough. My simple method of logging IP\naddresses when a page is loaded and counting the unique IP addresses each day\nsays that I've had 12 unique users. Much closer to the CloudFlare\nanalytics beta result, but I wouldn't expect my bespoke tool to be blocked by an\nAd Blocker.\n\nIf it were as simple as concluding that my own results agree with the CloudFlare\nanalytics beta then that might be enough. But they only agree on this particular\nmetric. I've logged 47 page views today using my own tool but the CloudFlare\nAnalytics beta reports only 11 page views[ref]With an average load time of 90ms -\npretty snappy if it can be believed.[/ref].\n\nPlease let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/johnmathews) if you have any\nideas!\n\n## CloudFlare Analytics\n\n[\n\n![cloudflare analytics tab](/static/images/cloudflare/cloudflare analytics tab.png)/images/cloudflare/cloudflare analytics tab.png)\n\n## CloudFlare Web Analytics\n\n[\n\n![cloudflare analytics beta](/static/images/cloudflare/cloudflare analytics beta.png)/images/cloudflare/cloudflare analytics beta.png)\n\n## My own analytics tool\n\n[\n\n![homebrew analytics](/static/images/cloudflare/homebrew_analytics_visitors.png)/images/cloudflare/homebrew_analytics_visitors.png)\n",

I'm confident that I'll still be using it twenty\nyears from now.\n\n1.  Filetype plugins - if you want some settings to be active only for\n    particular filetypes, like `.py` (python) or `.txt` (text) then create a file in\n    `~/.vim/ftplugin/<filetype>.vim`.\n\n    Vim will look in this file when it opens a buffer of the corresponding\n    file type. Good for formatting options like line length, tab spaces, vim\n    commands that are language specific.\n\n    You can't activate plugins in these files though. All the plugins have to be\n    activated in your `.vimrc` in the usual way.\n\n2.  `janko-m/vim-test` - this plugin lets you runs tests without leaving vim.\n    You can run the test that's nearest the cursor, or all the tests in the\n    current buffer. It's very customizable. I wish it could be a bit faster, but\n    I could probably improve that myself by changing some settings.\n\n3.  `dense-analysis/ale` - The incredible Asyncronous Linting Engine (A.L.E)\n    applies fixers and linters to various filetypes, when you want and how you want.\n    Super useful for writing tidy code and catching mistakes before the code is\n    run.\n\n4.  `junegunn/fzf` and `junegunn/fzf.vim` - It took a little getting used to at\n    first, but now I can't imagine not using a tool like this (this could be\n    said about so many vim-related things). Use `fzf` to switch between open\n    buffers, open a new file, search for files using the filename, or search\n    within all the files in the project for specific text.\n\n5.  `majutsushi/tagbar` - This plugin opens a sidebar which contains a list of\n    of functions and classes and methods (tags). You can use it to see which\n    methods a class contains, and jump to the part of the buffer where a tag\n    is defined.\n\nThis is my `.vimrc` during January 2021.\n\n```vim\n\" ========== Global ==========\nset nocompatible              \" always put it at the top of .vimrc. effects mappings, undo, etc.\nset encoding=utf-8            \" utf-8 encoding\nset termguicolors\nset t_Co=256                  \" number of colors\nset noerrorbells vb t_vb=     \" no error bells, yes screnflash.\nset linespace=8\nset scrolloff=2               \" minimum number of screen lines above and below the cursor\nset shortmess-=S              \" show how many times a search result occurs in current buffer, and index of current match\nset hidden\nset number relativenumber     \" Line numbers\nset splitbelow\nset splitright\n\" set tabstop=8 softtabstop=0 expandtab shiftwidth=4 smarttab\nset undofile                  \" Maintain undo history between sessions\nset undodir=~/.vim/undo       \" put all the undo files in this dir\n\nfiletype on                   \" enables filetype detection\nfiletype plugin indent on     \" detection on, plugin on, indent on.

      "\n\n## Update (2021-03-31):\n\nJust use neovim.coc instead of YouCompleteMe or Syntastic.\n\nIt's faster, easier to setup, and works intuitively. ALE is still wonderful and\nuseful, though there's a lot of overlap - coc can lint as well.\n\n## Jump Lists and Change Lists\n\nIf you're going to be jumping around to where things are defined, you will need\nto know how to jump back again. It seems there are two lists you need to be\naware of, the _jump list_[ref]`:help jumplist`[/ref] and the _change\nlist_[ref]`:help changelist`[/ref].\n\n### Jump List\n\n- A list of locations that the cursor has jumped to.\n- `<C-O>` move up the jump list\n- `<C-I>` mode down the jump list\n- Jumping to a definition, or a search result\n\n### Change List\n\n- `g;` and `g,` → move up and down the change list\n- A list of locations where a change was made.\n- `'.` → go to the location of your last edit (`.` is a mark).\n- `''` → go back to where you were before your last jump\n\n## Original Post:\n\nThere are multiple ways of doing anything with vim, including going to where a\nfunction or object is defined, and I usually need to do something at least 3 times\nbefore I can do it without breaking my focus or train of thought.\n\nMy memory is hazy but I remember spending a 1/2 day looking into this and\nconsidering which solution I wanted to commit to.[ref]The more powerful the\ntool, the more worthwhile it is to take a closer look at what it can and can't\ndo.[/ref] My options seemed to be between\n[YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) and\n[ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale). [Update![ref]YCM and\nALE work fine for goto definition and linting, but they don't give me\nsatisfactory autocompletion. `neoclide/coc.nvim` looks like it might offer some\nimprovements.\n[neoclide/coc.nvim](https://www.vimfromscratch.com/articles/vim-for-python/)[/ref]]\n\nI can't remember everything I read and tried, but I trust my conclusions.\nLooking in my `.vimrc` I see that I have `<leader>x` mapped to `:YcmCompleter GoTo` and it works just fine, even when a module is imported from somewhere\noutside the current project. The tool was working and ready to use, I just\nhadn't internalized it yet.\n\n## Commands to remember:\n\n- `<Leader>x` - GoTo definition - YCMs best guess at an 'intelligent' goto\n  command, whether its a declaration or a definition.\n- `<F2>` - Toggle tagbar\n",

      "\n\nVim is a text editor renowned for its efficiency and its use of keyboard\nshortcuts. It's based on the Vi text editor from the 1970's. It was first\nreleased in 1991 and is still being developed today. It comes pre-installed on\nUnix systems (including MacOS) and can be run from the terminal.\n\nVim is famous in another way too - for being difficult to learn. I found some\ngood and remarkably creative tools to begin learning its concepts and controls.\nThis was necessary because there is no GUI. There is a\n*game* [here](http://vim-adventures.com/), and there is [this interactive\ntutorial](http://www.openvim.com/). There's also a built-in vim tutorial - just\ntype 'vimtutor' into Terminal.\n\nVim is designed so that you don't need to take your hands off your keyboard and\nuse a mouse. It has the 'insert' mode where you enter text as usual, and the\n'command' mode where you can make use of a comprehensive and flexible shortcut\nlanguage to move around, edit and search the text. With no GUI or toolbar, it's\na very different approach to text editing than I'm used to.\n\nYou can run Vim from the terminal, but there are also versions that run as\napps. MacVim on MacOS has the option to show a tool bar of simple commands like\na normal program, and lets the arrow keys move the cursor in addition to VIM's\n'hjkl' functionality. This makes getting started a little simpler.\n\nThere are also a lot of plugins to extend Vim's functionality and turn it from\na text editor into an IDE. [This\npost](https://realpython.com/blog/python/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/) walks\nyou through setting up Vim as a Python IDE and explains how to manage various\nadd-ons.\n\nI recommend Daniel Mieslers [blog post](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/)\nfor a quick overview of how to use Vim.\n",

      "\n\n##What is a hardware wallet\nA hardware wallet (HW wallet) is a physical device that stores the information required to access digital currency or assets. It is plugged into a computer via USB in order to initiate or confirm transactions on the Bitcoin, Ethereum or other digital asset blockchain networks.\n\nThey are a secure method of storing cryptographic data. They are so secure that they can be used on a compromised computer. All that is needed to access funds using a HW wallet (in addition to the device itself) is a PIN code which the user chooses. A single HW wallet can store multiple currencies in multiple accounts.\n\nHW wallets are an easier solution than remembering a good password, and safer than storing the data in a file on my computer or online.\n\nThe best known hardware wallet brands are [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) and [Trezor](https://trezor.io/).\n\n##The problem\nHW wallets are technically great, but their size and shape creates a bad user experience. A good hardware wallet should be convenient to use multiple times each day, like a credit card is.\n\nCurrent hardware wallets don't fit into a (money) wallet and people don't want to carry more any objects in their pockets. They are too big and are a bad shape.\n\nHW wallets look like they might belong on a keyring, but it's inconvenient and insecure to attach a credit card to a keyring and the same is true for an HW wallet. I might store my keys on a hook by my door, but I would never leave my wallet there overnight. I often want to keep my keys and money separate because I need my keys when I’m near my house, where I don’t need to buy stuff, and I need my money when I’m away from my house where I don’t need to unlock anything.\n\nI want to keep my bank cards and cash together in one safe place, and I don’t want to carry around a dongle as well. It's inconvenient.\n\nIt’s easier to have a separate dongle lost or stolen than something that would fit next to my credit card in my wallet. The inconvenience is a barrier to enjoying the advantages of digital currencies.\n\n##The goal\nCreate a HW wallet that is the size and shape of a credit card, it could be 3 times thicker than a credit card and still fit in a normal wallet. It needs\n\n1. a display - it could be a low resolution b&w display\n2. two or more buttons\n3. to plug into a USB port\n4. securely sign transactions and create addresses\n",

      "\n\nPredicting the future sounds like a tough problem, but we try to do it all the\ntime without realising it.\n\nWe predict the future when we think about how risky or scary something is, or\nwhen we think about what's really going to change because of an announcement or\npress release. We try to predict the future when we're at the supermarket\ncheckouts and we try to pick the queue that will move the fastest. I always\nseem to pick the wrong one.\n\nThere must be a million ways of trying to predicting the future but all the good\nones are models which reduce complexity and emphasise key considerations. One\nof them could be comparing the influence of human nature and technology on the\noutcome, and then comparing the event to what's happened before.\n\nHuman nature doesn't change, so if something is driven by fear or greed then it\nprobably doesn't matter what century it occurs in. Technology _is_ change, and\nif something is enabled or prevented due to technological progress then the\ndate is important.\n\nWhat is driving the scenario? Is it human nature or technology? Supermarket\ncheckouts are mostly manual and require a couple of adults to work together, so\nhuman nature has a much bigger role on efficiency than tech. Young men will\nstack and pack quickly, old women will be the opposite. What types of shopping\nbags they have, or how they pay, or even how many items they're buying, are\nprobably not going to lead you to the right decision.\n\nThe same probably works for getting through airport security.\n",

S2F model suggests a peak around the beginning of 2021Q4, in the region of **&#36;300,000**.\n1. The rainbow chart seems to broadly agree with S2F.\n1. If the age-adjusted 3-month coin days destroyed goes above 550,000 then get ready to sell.\n1. Willy Woos \"double top\" chart suggests a peak around **&#36;400,000**.\n1. RationalRoot's comparison of bull runs suggests a market top around **14 September** and a maximum price around **&#36;2,000,000** [sic].\n1. RationalRoot's comparison of 12 months RSI suggests that the market top is reached shortly after a **12 month RSI exceeds 90**. This seems less reliable than the above points\n1. Jurrien Timmer suggests a peak price around &#36;100,000 if price shoots up unexpectedly quickly. I expect the market top to be significantly higher.\n1. &#36;100k will be a massive psychological level. If the price does increase to this level before approximately July then the optimal sell price would therefore not be exactly &#36;100,000.\n1. Market top is expected around **September 2021 at the earliest**.\n1. The behaviour of the market will change as its participants change. There hasn't been a bull run with significant institutional investors before.\n1. Sell using a cost averaging strategy.\n\n## Awareness\n\n- Buy when everyone is selling, sell when everyone is buying. Be brave when there is fear, if there is no fear then its about to get very messy.\n- If everyone is super confident that prices are definitely going to go up, something bad is about to happen.

It is the cumulative sum total of\ndaily market cap values divided by the age of the market in days.\n\n## Top Cap\n\nAverage Cap multipled by 35.\n\n## NVT Cap\n\nA valuation using monetray velocity. Checkout CoinMetrics for more info.\n\n## MVRV\n\nThe ratio of Market Value to Realised Value is calculated by dividing Bitcoin's\nmarket cap by its realised cap.\n\n## Realised Cap\n\nThe sum of the products of each UTXO and the market price of Bitcoin when the UTXO was generated.\n\n## Market Cap\n\nThe price of the most recent Bitcoin transaction multipled by the number of Bitcoin\n\n## UTXO\n\n_Unspent Transaction Outputs_. These are kind of like unspent coins. If you have\n1.5 BTC then you might have bought 2 and sold 0.5. The total value of UTXOs in\nyour wallet will be 1.5.\n\n## SOPR\n\nThe _Spent Output Profit Ratio_ is a measure of the average profit or loss on a\ncoin. Is a coin is moved when the price is higher than when it was received the\nSOPR increases, if a coin is moved when the price is lower than when the coin\nwas received then SOPR decreases.\n\nIt won't be accurate for individual coins but in aggregate it gives an idea of\nwhether coins are being sold at a loss or for profit.\n\nMarket participants who have owned BTC for 3 months behave differently to those\nthat have held BTC for 3 years. A more experienced investor will likely make\nmore measured and less rash decisions.\n\nBy segregating the UTXOs according to age you can compare old coins and new\ncoins, experienced and inexperienced investors (in aggregate).\n\nWeak hands will sell before stronger hands, and when market price decrease it's\nuseful to know aggregate age data for the coins being sold. If coins are moving\nfrom young wallets then the selling is likely much less significant than if\ncoins are being moved onto exchanges from old wallets.\n\n## aSOPR\n\nThe _Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio_ is the same as SOPR but it ignores\ncoins less than 1 hour old.\n\nIf profits are taken by old coins, aSOPR trends higher. It will trend lower\nwhen older (and therefore profitable) coins remain dormant.\n\nThe higher aSOPR is, the more profit has been taken off the table.\n\nWhen aSOPR is less than 1, spent coints are moved at an aggregate loss.\n\n## URPD\n\n_UTXO Realised Price Distribution_ - If a lot of coins have moved within a\nparticular price band, it is likely that there is strong price support and\nresistance at this price.\n\nThis would be truer and more reliable in a mature market. Because the market\nfor Bitcoin is expanding so rapidly and the price is so volatile, the attitudes\nand expectations of market participants is also much more malleable than in\ntraditional finance. For example, what was considered a very high price 12\nmonths ago would be considered a disaster today.\n\n## RSI\n\nThe _Relative Strength Index_ is borrowed directly from traditional finance.\nYou can calculate it over different time periods.\n\n## Miner Net Position\n\n_Miner Net Position_ shows the degree to which, on aggregate, Bitcoin miners\nare profiting from the coins they've generated from mining. Miners are expected\nto be among the most bullish of all market participants, and therefore it is\nnotable when they start moving coins from their mining wallets into exchange\nwallets.\n\n## Stock-to-Flow\n\nA stock to flow model is used to measure the scarcity of a commodity. It's a\ncalculation based on the ratio of existing supply and how much\nis being produced. The higher the ratio, the longer it will take for supply\nto meet existing demand.\n\nGold has a stock to flow ratio of 66, which means it would take 66 years at\nthe current rate of production to produce the amount of gold currently in\ncirculation. Silver has a S2F ratio of 74. BTC has a S2F of about 50.\n\n# Background\n\nOver the past 8 years, Bitcoin has gone through phases of rapid price increase\nfollowed by periods of rapid decrease. The price has been driven by increasing\nmarket size and a decreasing rate of issuance, and has been so volatile\n(compared to traditional finance) that \"1 month in cryptocurrency markets is\nlike 1 year in traditional markets\". However volatility is decreasing and we\nare seeing lower highs and higher lows during each subsequent market cycle.\n\nThe single biggest factor driving multi-year market cycles appears to be the\ndecreasing rate of supply increase (the issuance rate). The last 3 halvings[ref]Every 210,000\nblocks, the number of bitcoin awarded to the miner for successfully adding a\nblock is halved. The last halving occurred in May 2020 and the rate of issuance\nhalved from 12.5 BTC/block to 6.25 BTC/block[/ref] seem to have provoked the last\n3 bull cycles. We are in the third bull cycle now (April 2021) and I fully\nexpect it to be followed by a bear cycle.\n\nAs an amateur investor, I want to buy low and sell high. I'd like to time the\ntop and bottom of the market with reasonable accuracy, just like everyone else.\nBut I'm aware that my methods are less nuanced than professional traders and\nanalysts - I have access to less data than them and I'm not willing to put in\nas much effort as they are. I'm happy to do this\n[Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) style - I'll give it\n20% of my maximum effort and I'll be happy with 80% of an ideal result[ref]I\nrealise this probably isn't, strictly, what Mr. Pareto was thinking when he\npublished his research.

      "\n\nI've started writing more frequently. I want to do this because I often have\nthoughts which I'd like to explore and develop further but rarely do. Writing\nforces me to organise my thoughts and look at how substantial they really are,\nor aren't.\n\nThere is truth in the saying that \"to know a thing you need to be able to teach\nit\" [ref]Wikipedia\n[article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching), and some\n[external\nvalidation](https://web.archive.org/web/20210118112910/https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/).[/ref]\n, and writing well has several similarities to teaching. Can I really copy a\ncollection of thoughts from my head to yours?\n\nPowerful ideas are resilient and have many consequences. The older I get the more I believe\nthat ideas matter[ref]A complimentary notion is that asking the right question is more\nimportant than finding the right answer. I guess asking the right question is\nalways necessary, but finding the right answer is only sometimes [sufficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_and_sufficiency).\nSometimes you can get the answer a bit wrong if you asked the right question,\nand still get enough benefits to avoid the problem.[/ref]. They have so many\nsubtle consequences. They are the first\n[dominos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_effect).\n\nI don't expect writing regularly to become a permanent habit - it doesn't need\nto be. But I do want to focus on it for awhile so that I become significantly\nbetter. It's a skill that has too many benefits to be ignored.\n\nThe blogs I remember most are focussed and unapologetic about their priorities.\nMost of them have a lot of text and do not focus on design. They make it easy\nto read content and don't spend time or attention on header images or styling.\n\nBefore I redesigned this blog I had default settings that asked me to supply an\nimage for each post, and for a summary, and a suggested tweet. None of it was\nnecessary and whilst they all tried to make the blog better they ended up\nmaking it harder to write. These peripheral features added complexity and\ndistracted from the main thing.\n\nThey're are still there if I want to use them but they are not set up\nto be used by default anymore. They've been moved to the background and if I\nforget they exist then that's OK - it just shows they weren't as important in\npractice as I thought they would be. I was probably just having fun adding new\nfeatures and working out how to build them.\n\n[You Ain't Gonna Need\nIt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it), mate.\n",

You can\nsource and valid Zsh code.\n\n`exec` replaces the current shell process with another process. Your terminal\n(`tty`) session is running a shell.
