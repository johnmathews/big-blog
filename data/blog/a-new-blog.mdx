## Background

Previously, I'd been building this blog using Pelican, a Static Site Generator
written in Python that uses Jinja templates. It's accessible and has all the
functionality I needed, but as the amount of blog content has grown it has
become slow and cumbersome.

Waiting for edits to a blog post had become slow enough to discourage me from
making care-free edits, and I knew it would impact the way I used the site. And
it would only get worse as the amount of content increased.

So I took the plunge and committed to using a more performant static site
generator. I started by looking at [this list](https://jamstack.org/generators/)
on jamstack.org, and thought that [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) would be a good choice.

Hugo would be great, but JavaScript is everywhere, and apparently so is React.
Being unfamiliar with modern JavaScript web frameworks felt increasingly like an
obstacle I had to work hard to avoid, and I know those kind of feelings are bad for
creativity and happy coincidence.

It was this [firebase video](https://youtu.be/SJeBRW1QQMA) that convinced me to commit to
React and Next.js, rather than some other framework, or meta-framework, like
[Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/). Nuxt might be
simpler, but if you're only going to be familiar with one framework, you might
as well make it React. It is the de facto standard.

## Conversion

Converting the [old blog](https://python-blog.johnmathews.is) to Next.js was a
much larger undertaking than I expected, partly because I needed to convert the
markdown files containing the post data, but mostly because I wanted to bring
across all the functionality from the Python site:

- state management,
- dark theme,
- keyboard shortcuts,
- search,
- custom web analytics,
- the snippets page,
- the collections,
- embedding YouTube videos, or other content using MDMX

None of these features are novel or groundbreaking, it just requires a level of
proficiency that isn't trivial, and that I didn't have.

Converting all the blog posts took a long time because the frontmatter had to be
converted to yaml, and timestamps, tags and categories had to be formatted
correctly. I also needed to change how iframes (mostly youtube videos) were
embedded in blog posts.

Converting Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts was another mini project. State
management across components, not just passing state to children, took a
while to figure out. Grokking react is not trivial.

I now have something that will hopefully remain performant and fun-to-use for a
long time. React doesn't seem like its going anywhere soon. Maybe (just maybe)
this will be the last front-end web framework I decide to learn. Ha.
