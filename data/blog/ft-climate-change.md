- If any of this is true then it seems silly to not think about it or be actively concerned with it
- Personally, this feels difficult to think about because:
  - I don't know how to start
  - Day to day (or month to month) life seems a bit precarious. I'd like more security before doing
    something that feels unknown.

I have decided, for me, that I would rather be poor and fulfilled than rich and unfulfilled.

I would prefer to suffer financial stress and have a balanced healthy lifestyle, than have an
unfulfilling and stressful life that is financially secure.

Focussing on avoiding financial stress to the detriment of all else feels weak, cowardly, and stupid.

## A balanced healthy lifestyle

1. Time outdoors in natural environments.
2. A community of friends and slow relationships.
3. Agency to choose how I spend some of my time.
4. Activities driven by curiosity, reflection, intellectual pursuits, what is valuable.
5. A reasonable degree of modest financial security.

## An unhealthy lifestyle

1. Transactional relationships.
2. Making decisions based on fear of the unknown, what-ifs, maybes, and poorly defined "bad things".
3. Lack of exercise.
4. Time in built-up urban environments.
5. Doing things because that is how they're done. Fitting in. Going with the flow, etc.

## How to get started doing something I don't know how to do

1. Just start producing something - anything.
   - this blog post
   - unordered notes posted on the fridge
2. Look for people to talk to
3. Make it easy for people to talk to you
4. Enjoy the process
