A super awkward summary of the last 2 weeks. It's not got polish, but it's real.

Since the last video:

- Newness and novelty is wearing off fast. It’s time to build. And that’s good.

- Bigger items are

  - Submitted an innovation proposal for an R&D subsidy. It would extend runway by several months

  - Created a basic marketing site. Its v1, but it’s there to be iterated on now

  - Completed a basic javaScript course

  - React looks good

  - Made my blog work again

  - Updated my personal web site with reviews, and funky colors. Did it so that its done and I can forget about it

- Last week I went down multiple rabbit holes reading about various web technologies

  - This is tiring

  - Probably a poor use of time

  - But that’s only clear in hindsight

    - Cube.js - amazing!

    - AWS - big and confusing

    - React - looks fine to me

    - D3

    - AWS Cognito

    - AWS AppSync

    - Create React App

    - etc. yawn.

- This week:

  - No more rabbit holes

  - Build something basic, not full featured and scalable

  - Back to Django, and d3 for the first version of the dashboard view.

  - I want more momentum

- Lifestyle

  - Good - I'm creating habits that are going to help me be healthy and productive

    - Reading each day

    - Running more and more

- What have you learnt?

  - Boring technologies are preferable to new and untested - react is more boring than vue

  - how the graphQL api spec compares to REST apis

  - Frameworks - Django is (still) the most sensible option for me. Not express, not flask.

  - I’m seeing myself as wearing 3 hats

    - Executive (strategy)

    - Developer (writing the code)

    - Manager - make the developer productive, and achieve the executive's goals

  - I'm coaching myself and I find sport comparisons useful.

  - I’m thinking of this as a sport in a lot of ways

  - I'm borrowing a lot of advice from runners

    - Consistency

    - Gratitude

    - Focus

    - Hardwork

    - Environment

    - Rest

    - Keeping it simple (I probably have the most beautiful CLI in the country, which is stupid)

- Next week

  - Build! Momentum!

  - Django, basic d3.

  - Should have done this last week..
