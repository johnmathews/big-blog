4 years ago I started learning how to code, and it was difficult! It still is
difficult, but I now have a collection of tools and perspectives that make it
less daunting. Leveling up requires one more abstraction
to wrap my head around, or one more API to understand. I can do it.

But I don't think it needed to be so difficult, so now I'm building [Code
School Meta](https://codeschoolmeta.com) to make it easier to learn how to
code.

Learning to code has been fun, ultimately successful, and life changing (hello
job security!) but at the beginning it was sooo slow, and super tricky.

Imposter syndrome is real, and I definitely felt it. I hadn't taken any classes
in computer science, and I felt like I knew almost nothing about anything.

The process began with Pandas, a (_the_) Python analytics library. Spreadsheets
were slowing me down at work, and I was bored. I found this [great
tutorial](https://youtu.be/5JnMutdy6Fw) by Brandon Rhodes. From there I found
out about Jupyter Notebooks, and then I found about Github pages and how to
make a blog using [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).

That led to HTML and CSS (and also JavaScript, which I tried very hard to avoid
for as long as possible). I felt like a monkey bashing a keyboard as I tried to
make HTML elements do what I wanted.

Unusally, I think Git was next. Mainly because I found this [amazing
tutorial](git) to help me learn. It made Git seem OK,
and also helped HTML and CSS make more sense too. Bonus!

I suddenly realized that great learning materials are crucial if I was going to
keep momentum and keep on enjoying the thrill of seeing the computer do
something I hadn't made it do before.

So now I'm now working on [Code School: Meta](https://codeschoolmeta.com). It's
an online community to make it easier to teach yourself how to code - less
confusion about how to get started or what to learn next, more encouragement,
and lots of high quality resources.
