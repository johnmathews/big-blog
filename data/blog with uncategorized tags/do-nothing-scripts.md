Interesting
[article](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/)
about writing down a list of manual steps for tasks that can't be automated. A
do-nothing script can take some of the toil out of a manual slog.

Even though the script doesn't do anything other than display text on a screen
(the instructions to complete the task) it's still helpful, because:

- All the steps and information required are collected together.
- It lowers the activation energy required to do something fiddly.
- Each step is part of a function, and the function can be updated with
  automation code if automation becomes possible.
- It's more difficult to lose your place in the process, or get the order of
  steps wrong.

It doesn't reduce manual effort. It does reduce toil.
