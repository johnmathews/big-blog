# [PipPip](https://pippip.email)

6 weeks ago I had an idea for a product whilst reading a news article.

It would be great if the writing and sending of important messages could be
separated, so that I could write something long before I needed to send it, and
know that then sending would happen at the right time without having to think
about it. This could be useful for sending my daughter a message on her 15th
birthday, or to my wife on our 10th anniversary. I also designed a check-in
mechanism, so that messages could be sent if I disappeared or pass away.

[PipPip](https://PipPip.email) is the result - event-driven and scheduled email delivery, from days to decades

We're working on validating the idea and finding the right niche audience.
