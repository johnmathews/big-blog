## Background

### My name is "two loaves of bread"

To me, language learning has always been either intimidating or boring. It started off badly when,
sometime around the age of ten I walked into a bakery in France and announced that my name was "a
loaf of bread", and i would like to buy "a John". Everyone laughed. Later on at secondary school I
was so shy that even the thought of speaking in German, french or Spanish class was terrifying.

Having said all that, I spend a couple of months in Mexico when I was ~20 and I somehow went from
not being able to order food at the beginning, to discussing (badly) politics with a local. I'm
still not sure how. I've never taken a Spanish class, but did try some conversational language
courses and watched some movies.

### The traditional approach is miserable

When I lived in Vienna I took German classes and initially spent quite a lot of effort trying to
memorize vocabulary and grammar, and had very little functional language at the end of it. All it
really did was make me feel self-conscious and inadequate.

At least I learnt how _not_ to learn a language - it became very clear to me that learning a
language couldn't be done like math or engineering. Rules could be broken, things didn't need to be
completely right to be useful, and if an apparently random word or phrase appears in my head in a
certain context its probably correct and should be used without thinking about it too much. This is
all very different to math.

### Why now

I've lived in the Netherlands for 5 years now, and I haven't needed to learn Dutch at all. The
locals have an incredibly wide-spread level of proficiency speaking English, and culturally the
Dutch are very welcoming and open to speaking English - I think its kind of trendy, and people often
want to practice or demonstrate their English proficiency with me. Still, I feel arrogant for
"forcing" people to speak my language, and recently I've decided that I'd like to become Dutch. My
children are growing up here, attending Dutch schools, and its entirely possible that I might never
speak a word of English to my grandchildren, so it's time I learnt.

## Learning how to learn

So I've decided that I want to learn, and that it needs to become a fun hobby - something that I
enjoy and feels like a form of play.

I've recently taken up running and enjoy it a lot, even though many people consider it "hard work",
or something they could never do. I've tried to think about why I think about it so differently, and
apply those learnings to language learning (and also photography, but that's for another post.) As
with most things, YouTube is a fantastic way to teach yourself, and before I jumped into learning
Dutch, I watched a few videos about how to learn a language. This is what I've learned, and what I
need to remember (because part of me likes flashcard and vocab drills, even though it doesn't result
in vocab being available when I need it in real situations)

## Notes

- [Kaufmann] Don't try to learn the basics, there is a natural order (for you, and people like you)
  and just go with the flow. It doesn't matter if you make some mistakes on something for a while,
  you'll figure it out, just like a child does.

- Prioritize the phrases you use and hear the most
- Prioritize how to express yourself, and your normal situations. Don't use someone else's structure

- Accept uncertainty
- Accept that you don't and won't understand everything
- Don't try to understand too much, it's like mowing a lawn

- If you understand well, you will eventually speak well

### TPRS is Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling

- Reading is fresh Comprehensible Input (CI)

- Find the right instructor (for you).
- Avoid reading and writing, just tell stories and describe pictures
- Get many language parents

- Magazines and children's books with pictures of things that are relevant to you
- Ask the expert to lovingly describe the pictures and ask me simple yes or no questions about the
  picture
- Then I ask the expert simple questions like "what is this?" "what is he doing?" "why?"
- Why questions are really good

- Storytelling is a great language acquisition method.

- If you get stuck, you can draw
- If you get really stuck, just say "Het is niet belangrijk" and then move on.
- No grammar, it doesn't help.
- Don't bother with corrections, they don't work.
- No English
- Total Physical Response (TPR) - act it out, (whilst sitting if you want, with hand motions etc)

- Read a lot
- Input+1 (I+1): Input is what you know, the +1 is something a bit extra, beyond your level. Ask for
  some i+1.

- Apps are better than nothing, but they're not as good as storytelling with a human
- Record your lessons and listen back to them. Repetition is great.

### Interview

- Come up with your own strategy
- Language discovery is a personal process. People will disagree about what the best methods are,
  the experts don't agree.
- Different parts of your personality come through differently in different languages, this is
  normal.
- Even though you are always the same person, language learning is about imitating culture and
  therefore you superficially change a bit.
- Listen a lot - you cannot pronounce what you cannot hear, and after a while your brain will get
  used to the new sounds of a new language.
- Phrases imply the intonation
- Massive amounts of repetitive reading and listening
- He uses a tutor after he knows 3000 - 5000 words, the exact amount varies depending on the
  language.
- Start using a tutor when you want to start using a tutor. You should be comfortable and want to do
  it, not apprehensive or embarrassed.
- Be the owner of your own journey
- Start speaking to people when you have about 5000 words, Sooner if you want to.
- Accents are OK, don't worry about it.
