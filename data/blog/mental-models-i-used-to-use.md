The rules[ref]or policies[/ref] and mental models that helped me
succeed in one season or phase of life may not be the best for the next phase.

Here is a list of a few mental models I remember being concious of in previous
years. Probably I've already forgotten some.

1.  _Always ask "why..."_. Be obsessive about this. It's going to make things
    harder for a while before things get easier. You'll find difficult answers
    that you otherwise wouldn't. If you're only concerned with the present then
    its true that ignorance is bliss, but otherwise it's a liability.

2.  _"What if..."_ is another good question to ask a lot.

3.  _Adapt_ to the situation, don't make it adapt to you if you have any
    choice. Be kind of like water, going around things and through the gaps.
    Look for the edges and the gaps, the parts that aren't well known.

4.  _Let people talk_ as much as they want to. Shut up and listen. If they
    mean you harm or don't respect you then it'll become more obvious the more
    they keep talking. If they mean you well or they're saying something
    useful, you will benefit more from letting them talk more.

5.  _Inversion_ - it can be hard to know if you should do something, but how
    would you feel if you didn't do it, or if it didn't happen?

6.  _Regrets are inevitable_, everyone has them. Same as making mistakes. Let
    your regrets be for things that you did do, and not what you didn't do.

7.  If you are willing to try something, fail at it, and still be glad that you
    tried, then you should almost definitely do it. Commit to it and enjoy the
    experience! Don't be scared, or at least, be scared _and_ optimistic and
    happy[ref]Courage isn't the absence of fear. It's being scared and doing
    the right thing anyway.[/ref].

8.  There is beauty and luxury in being in such a bad spot that you are backed
    into a corner with seemingly no way out. Things become black and white,
    instead of shades of gray, and that will make priorities and options much
    clearer. You are likely to work very efficiently and effectively in this
    scenario, and you will learn important things about yourself.

    Now that I'm older and I have responsibilities, I can't ever let things
    become so bad that a situation becomes black and white. I have to
    navigate a world of grays. If they do become black and white, I'll
    already have a long list of failings.

    When I was younger, things were more fragile. My resources were smaller and
    things could quickly flip from good to bad. Enjoy the few benefits that a
    situation like that gives, because (hopefully) once its gone its gone for
    good.

9.  The best way to solve a problem is to prevent it from occurring in the first
    place. Succeeding at this will bring its own challenges.

10. Take responsibility for things you are not responsible for, kind of. Do it
    deliberately and for your own benefit, but don't forget that you are only
    pretending that it's your responsibility.

    If you do this, you will force yourself to understand a situation more
    deeply and from other peoples perspectives. This will let you learn faster
    and help you in future. Keep this at arms length though - it's make-believe
    and you need to be able to switch it on and off. It's a toy for you to play
    with. This seems to be what "extreme responsibility" is.

I think its important to have mental models that you're comfortable with,
because it lets you make decisions quickly and consistently. But understand
that [the map is not the
territory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/), and these are just
tools in a toolbox.
