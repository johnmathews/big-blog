I'm really enjoying math explainers lately, on YouTube there's
[3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) and
[Veritsasium](https://www.youtube.com/c/veritasium), and for text I've enjoyed a
couple of [Matt Ferraro's](https://mattferraro.dev/https://mattferraro.dev/)
blog posts.

Check out [What is the inverse of a
vector?](https://mattferraro.dev/posts/geometric-algebra) and [Poisson's
Equation is the Most Powerful Tool not yet in your
Toolbox](https://mattferraro.dev/posts/poissons-equation).

This is a great explanation of the geometric reasoning for the solution to
quadratics and cubics, which then goes on to introduce imaginary numbers.
