Design patterns are generalized abstractions that solve common problems and help
engineers create complex code reliably and quickly. I first heard about design
patterns from Aaron Maxwell in his [Powerful
Python](https://powerfulpython.com/) newsletter, and made some
[notes](python-notes) in an earlier article.

Then the YouTube algorithm put the following video on my front page, and down
the rabbit hole I went.

Take a look at the Borg design pattern.

<div class="relative mt-3" style="padding-top: 56.25%">
  <iframe
    class="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full"

    frameborder="0"
    allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen >
  </iframe>
</div>
