This site is a mixture of my notes, a portfolio and a record of my hobbies and
interests. It might be morphing into a
[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). It's a personal
project and somewhere I can experiment with web and cloud technologies.

Most of my work is as a freelance
[data-scientist]({filename}/pages/azure-image-recognition-demo.md). I also do
[web development]({filename}/pages/website-analytics.md) and
<a href="https://johnmathews.is/category/technical/cryptocurrencies.html">blockchain</a> infrastructure work.

If you have questions, comments or find a mistake, you can find me on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/johnmathews) or [email](mailto:mthwsjc@gmail.com). Thanks for reading!
