As a hacker, or creator, or whatever the best label is, I always want to create
something (usually code) and have it finished.

But a strange creativity and productivity boost comes from dabbling, dipping in
and out.

I think that if the technical challenges aren't too hard, then the main
criteria for success is creativity.

Creativity needs time away from the project, and sleep, to bubble up and let
ideas grow.

Ultimately, the most successful path is usually the most interesting, because
success has more consequences than failure. "Interesting" requires elements of
novelty and surprise, and without creativity these elements can't flourish. 3/n

Dabbling results in more creativity than 6+ hours of strenuous work, and is
more likely to give you satisfying results.
