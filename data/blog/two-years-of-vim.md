I've been feeling very comfortable with my Vim + Tmux setup recently.
Navigating around shells and files isn't taking much mental effort anymore.
Wohoo!

It's taken about 2 years of working full time with vim to get to the stage
where the commands are so intuitive that:

1.  I pepper text files outside of vim (email, notes, etc) with vim keys
    accidentally - `j` `k` `x` etc

2.  I can't remember what the command is to do something if I'm not actually
    doing it. When I need to do an action, I do it from muscle
    memory and I only pay attention to the underlying key press if something
    goes wrong.

    This is noticeable when trying to find an unbound key combination for some
    new action, or when reading an article about vim and thinking "that's new"
    when actually I've been doing it without noticing.

3.  A pleasant surprise has been that it doesn't take much effort to
    rebind a single command and retrain myself to use it. This is presumably
    because the mental effort for all the other commands has become negligible.
    In the early days, retraining a key combination took a lot more effort
    because I was already making an effort to get used to doing things in Vim.

4.  I can work even when my vision is blurry (and my speech slurred and my head
    heavy) because I can use text objects and navigation commands to get to
    where I know text is. I'm not saying I _should_ work when I'm that tired,
    but I can, if I'm already familiar with the code/file..
