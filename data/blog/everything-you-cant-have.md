A post by Morgan House on the [collabfund](https://collabfund.com/blog/everything-you-cant-have/)
blog. It's an interesting exploration of the psychology of want and value, but I think the article
makes too much of being a slave to dopamine only.

I think that the state described in the article is a base state that we can grow out of, with
practice, and that the article assumes implicitly that we are all more selfish than we necessarily
are.

However, the beginning of the article is such a nice description of the foolishness that we begin
with that I have copied it here.

## Nothing is as desired as much as the thing you want but can’t have.

In fact for most people there’s a hierarchy of wants that goes something like this:

> If you don’t want something and don’t have it, you don’t think about it. If you want something and
> have it, you might feel OK. If you want something and don’t have it, you might feel motivated. If
> you want something and can’t have it, you drive yourself mad.

A few years after leaving office, Richard Nixon mentioned that the richest people in the world are
some of the unhappiest, because they can afford to never struggle.

“Drinking too much. Talking too much. Thinking too little. Retired. No purpose,” he said.

To ordinary people, it sounds amazing. To those who can afford to do anything, it often falls flat.

Nixon elaborated:

> You feel that, gee, isn’t it just great to have enough money to afford to live in a very nice
> house, to be able to play golf, to have nice parties, to wear good clothes, to travel if you want
> to? And the answer is: If you don’t have those things, then they can mean a great deal to you.
> When you do have them, they mean nothing to you.

This is a little exaggerated. But the idea of valuing only what you’ve struggled for is real.

In 1905, author William Dawson wrote in his book _The Quest for The Simple Life_ about how the
hardest thing to understand about money is the thrill of the chase. Something you can easily afford
brings less joy than something you must save and struggle for. “The man who can buy anything he
covets values nothing that he buys,” Dawson wrote.

He went on:

> There is a subtle pleasure … in the anxious debates which we hold with ourselves whether we can or
> cannot afford a certain thing; in our attempts to justify our wisdom; in the risk and recklessness
> of our operations; in the long deferred and final joy of our possession. But this is a kind of
> pleasure which the man of boundless means never knows. The buying of pictures affords us an
> excellent illustration on this point. [Ordinary people] … have to walk weary miles and wait long
> weeks to get upon the track of their treasure; to use all their knowledge of art and men to
> circumvent the malignity of dealers; to experience the extremes of trepidation and of hope; to
> deny themselves comforts, and perhaps food, that they may pay the price which has at last, after
> infinite dispute, reached an irreducible minimum; and the pleasure of their possession is in the
> ratio of their pains. But the man who enters a sale-room with the knowledge that he can have
> everything he wishes by the signing of a cheque feels none of these emotions.
