summary: This analysis was a technical exercise I completed as part of a job application. <p></p> It's a brief demonstration of some of my statistics and programming skills and was written in a Jupyter Notebook. This blog is generated using the [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) blogging framework which makes it super easy to convert a notebook to a blog post.
