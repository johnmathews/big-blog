Towards the end of the fourth day, or maybe fifth, I finally figured out how to
make the code do what I wanted it to do and run without errors. I found the
blind-spot.

There are some take-aways about naming conventions, and how to structure a code
base. I also have some thoughts about pandas. I guess the general conclusion is
that with more power comes more responsibility. Code can be written in many
ways, but only a few of them will let developers work as efficiently as
possible.

Programming is an art and the only way to get good at writing complex code is to
practice.

Also, I'd like to find a code visualization tool that can show the flow of classes and
methods as they are instantiated.
