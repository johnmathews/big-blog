A [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/aarondfrancis/status/1438888219471491074)
showing how a business started creating handwritten notes to customers using a
plotter, and how they scaled up and further automated the process.

It would be cool to create something like this for western Europe.
[Handwrytten.com](https://handwrytten.com) seems to be the main commercial

I still think it would be fun to make a simple photo printing service. Share a
photo in a WhatsApp message and its printed and delivered.
