Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may
be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than
under omnipotent moral busybodies.

The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point
be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without
end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more
likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth.

This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured"
against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to
be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those
who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.

\- C. S. Lewis
