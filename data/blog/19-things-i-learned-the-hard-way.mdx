Notes on an [email](https://ckarchive.com/b/n4uohvh83le08) from Louis Grenier

10. Fear obscurity, not rejection. You will be rejected; that's a fact and a part of running a
    business. So, focus on what you can control: being seen.

11. Don't make assumptions on top of assumptions. It's so easy to live in your head and treat
    half-truths as THE truth. But it's like a house of cards that can collapse any second. Instead,
    ship small, and learn fast.

12. You can't change people's minds, so don't try to. I used to love debating with friends in high
    school, but the world has become more polarized (at least, I think it has!). Work with people
    who already believe what you believe.

13. It’s never going to feel “perfect.” It’s always going to be chaotic. If you’re looking for
    stability, this isn’t it. You'll never feel ready; everything always feels like
    work-in-progress.

14. A 4-day workweek is more productive than a 5-day. I was skeptical at first, but it works. I use
    my Fridays to spend time with my daughter and run errands (doctor's appointments, etc.). I feel
    way more productive.

15. Anyone can do anything for a week. Everyone can start a podcast, a weekly newsletter, or wake up
    at 5 AM to attend a networking event. But can you sustain this pace for six months? A year? Five
    years?

16. Caricature yourself to be understood quickly by your people. I don't mean physically. I mean,
    don't expect your audience to grasp the nuances of your personality after coming across your
    Twitter profile for the first time. Do the emotional labor on their behalf so they get the 5% of
    information that matters.

17. Your biggest challenge is closing the gap between what you are/believe and how you come across
    to the outside world.

18. Unless you're a creative genius with decades of experience, you first need to do a lot of stuff
    to see what sticks. And then you can focus on quality.

19. Always be marketing. This is your primary job. Serving customers and creating products come
    second. Why? Because, if you have more demand that you can handle, you can afford to make
    mistakes and invest into the other areas supporting marketing. Be in demand, and all your other
    problems become small challenges.
