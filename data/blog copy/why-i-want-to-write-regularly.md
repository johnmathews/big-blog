I've started writing more frequently. I want to do this because I often have
thoughts which I'd like to explore and develop further but rarely do. Writing
forces me to organise my thoughts and look at how substantial they really are,
or aren't.

There is truth in the saying that "to know a thing you need to be able to teach
it" [ref]Wikipedia
[article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching), and some
[external
validation](https://web.archive.org/web/20210118112910/https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/).[/ref]
, and writing well has several similarities to teaching. Can I really copy a
collection of thoughts from my head to yours?

Powerful ideas are resilient and have many consequences. The older I get the more I believe
that ideas matter[ref]A complimentary notion is that asking the right question is more
important than finding the right answer. I guess asking the right question is
always necessary, but finding the right answer is only sometimes [sufficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_and_sufficiency).
Sometimes you can get the answer a bit wrong if you asked the right question,
and still get enough benefits to avoid the problem.[/ref]. They have so many
subtle consequences. They are the first
[dominos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_effect).

I don't expect writing regularly to become a permanent habit - it doesn't need
to be. But I do want to focus on it for awhile so that I become significantly
better. It's a skill that has too many benefits to be ignored.

The blogs I remember most are focussed and unapologetic about their priorities.
Most of them have a lot of text and do not focus on design. They make it easy
to read content and don't spend time or attention on header images or styling.

Before I redesigned this blog I had default settings that asked me to supply an
image for each post, and for a summary, and a suggested tweet. None of it was
necessary and whilst they all tried to make the blog better they ended up
making it harder to write. These peripheral features added complexity and
distracted from the main thing.

They're are still there if I want to use them but they are not set up
to be used by default anymore. They've been moved to the background and if I
forget they exist then that's OK - it just shows they weren't as important in
practice as I thought they would be. I was probably just having fun adding new
features and working out how to build them.
