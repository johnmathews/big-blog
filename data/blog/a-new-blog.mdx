Previously I'd been using Pelican, a Static Site Generator written in Python
that uses Jinja templates. It was accessible and had all the functionality I
needed, but as the amount of blog content grew it became very slow to render the
content and make deployments. It was sow enough to discourage me from making
fast or care-free edits, and I knew it would impact the way I used the site. And
I knew it would only get worse.

So I took the plunge and committed to using a more performant static site
generator. I started by looking at this [list](https://jamstack.org/generators/)
on jamstack.org, and thought that Hugo would be a good choice.

Hugo would be great, but I'm JavaScript is everywhere, and
apparently so is React. It was really awkward not being comfortable with modern
JavaScript

It was this [firebase video](https://youtu.be/SJeBRW1QQMA) that convinced me to commit to
React and Next.js.

It was a much larger undertaking than I expected, partly because I wanted to bring across
all the functionality from the Python site - state management, dark mode, keyboard shortcuts, search, custom web
analytics, the snippets page, the collections, embedding YouTube videos using
MDMX...

None of these features are novel or groundbreaking, it just requires a level of proficiency
that isn't trivial, and that I didn't have.

Converting all the blog posts also took a long time. The frontmatter had to be
converted to yaml, and timestamps, tags and categories had to be formatted
correctly. I also needed to change how iframes (mostly youtube videos) were
embedded in blog posts.

Converting Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts was also a mini project. State
management across components, not just passing state to children, took a
while to figure out.

I now have something that will hopefully remain usable and fun-to-use for a
long time. React doesn't seem like its going anywhere soon. Maybe (just maybe)
this will be the last front-end web framework I decide to learn. Ha.
