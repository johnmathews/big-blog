## My name is "two loaves of bread"

To me, language learning has always been either intimidating or boring. It started off badly when,
sometime around the age of ten I walked into a bakery in France and announced that my name was "a
loaf of bread", and i would like to buy "a John". Everyone laughed. Later on at secondary school I
was so shy that even the thought of speaking in German, french or Spanish class was terrifying.

Having said all that, I spend a couple of months in Mexico when I was ~20 and I somehow went from
not being able to order food at the beginning, to discussing (badly) politics with a local. I'm
still not sure how. I've never taken a Spanish class, but did try some conversational language
courses and watched some movies.

## The traditional approach is miserable

When I lived in Vienna I took German classes and initially spent quite a lot of effort trying to
memorize vocabulary and grammar, and had very little functional language at the end of it. All it
really did was make me feel self-conscious and inadequate.

At least I learnt how _not_ to learn a language - it became very clear to me that learning a
language couldn't be done like math or engineering. Rules could be broken, things didn't need to be
completely right to be useful, and if an apparently random word or phrase appears in my head in a
certain context its probably correct and should be used without thinking about it too much. This is
all very different to math.

## Why now

I've lived in the Netherlands for 5 years now, and I haven't needed to learn Dutch at all. The
locals have an incredibly wide-spread level of proficiency speaking English, and culturally the
Dutch are very welcoming and open to speaking English - I think its kind of trendy, and people often
want to practice or demonstrate their English proficiency with me. Still, I feel arrogant for
"forcing" people to speak my language, and recently I've decided that I'd like to become Dutch. My
children are growing up here, attending Dutch schools, and its entirely possible that I might never
speak a word of English to my grandchildren, so it's time I learnt.

## Learning how to learn

So I've decided that I want to learn, and that it needs to become a fun hobby - something that I
enjoy and feels like a form of play.

I've recently taken up running and enjoy it a lot, even though many people consider it "hard work",
or something they could never do. I've tried to think about why I think about it so differently, and
apply those learnings to language learning (and also photography, but that's for another post.) As
with most things, YouTube is a fantastic way to teach yourself, and before I jumped into learning
Dutch, I watched a few videos about how to learn a language. This is what I've learned, and what I
need to remember (because part of me likes flashcard and vocab drills, even though it doesn't result
in vocab being available when I need it in real situations)
