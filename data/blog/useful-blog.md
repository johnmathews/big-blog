Just found a really useful [blog](https://seb.jambor.dev)

Interesting [discussion](https://seb.jambor.dev/posts/cd-is-not-a-program/) about the difference between builtins and executables,

Nice examples of using `fzf` to [improve workflows](https://seb.jambor.dev/posts/improving-shell-workflows-with-fzf/).
