### Updated: 10 Feb 2021

I found a [blog post](https://brandur.org/fragments/rss-abandon) which is
surprisingly similar to my thoughts on RSS feeds, but better presented and
thought through. The post mentions the idea that "RSS is about capturing the
long tail of blogs that don't post frequently"[^1].

This idea crystalised why I was so glad I'd started using RSS feeds
again. If readers use RSS, then authors don't need to concern themselves with
attention. This removes pressure on the author to post
frequently and lets them focus on quality over quantity. News feeds and ad
supported platforms have fundamentally different mechanics and incentives.

With RSS I can let good quality content come to me, on its own schedule. I
don't need to remember to look for it, and the authors don't need to remind me
that they exist.

## Google Reader

RSS is a very effective way of having good quality information
come to you. Back in 2008, I used to use Google Reader to subscribe to RSS
feeds. I was an aspiring photographer back then and I remember being subscribed
to around 80 blogs. Each day I'd read articles from whoever had posted
something new, without needing to visit their websites or remember who they are
or that I'd subscribed to their blog. The authors didn't need to optimize their
output according to an opaque and changing algorithm either - they didn't need
to optimize article length, tags, post frequency, image inclusion or linked
content. They could write how they wanted to, which I suspect leads to higher
quality content.

## Social Media

A few years later Google Reader was closed down, presumably because using RSS
didn't fit with Googles advertising model. I was unaware of it at the time but
I imagine it sent shockwaves through blogging communities and probably upended
many businesses. I mostly stopped reading blogs.

Facebook was growing fast, Instagram felt new and exciting, and content was
moving onto 'platforms', or into walled gardens. And as they kept on growing
the average quality of the content decreased.

Twitter is like this now I think. There are some real diamonds to be found from
time to time, but there's a lot of mud too. Mostly its just mud, but the
occasional diamond can have outsized benefits.

RSS isn't like this. I choose the contents of my 'news feed', and
each article can be much longer than a Tweet, or a caption to a photo, or a
status update. It's hard to write well and to create an interesting or useful blog
post, and that makes it harder to dilute quality with entertaining
distractions. I have complete control about what content I see, and I can
change it whenever I want. The process is designed around me.

## Reeder5

I used `netNewsWire` for a few weeks, but it couldn't sync between my laptop
and phone, so I bought `Reeder 5`. It's got a few unusual design patterns, but
it works well and has all the features I want. I've been unsubscribing from
email newsletters and subscribing to the RSS feed instead.

It keeps my inbox quieter, and it feels good to have a 'separation of
concerns'. It makes it easier to read interesting content without being
distracted.
