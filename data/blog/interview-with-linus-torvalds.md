From an [Interview](https://tag1consulting.com/blog/interview-linus-torvalds-linux-and-git:):

I don't want to claim that programming is an art, because it really is mostly
just about 'good engineering'. I'm a big believer in Thomas Edison's 'one
percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration' mantra. It's almost
all about the little details and the everyday grunt-work.

But there is that occasional 'inspiration' part, that 'good taste' thing that
is about more than just solving some problem - solving it cleanly and nicely
and yes, even beautifully.
