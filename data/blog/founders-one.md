Last summer, I made dashboard using python to visualise my personal finances. I
could see my expenses agregated by category and I could see how much I was
saving each month. I set some targets and tracked my spending against them. It
ran locally, and making it worked required using the CLI. A few friends asked
how they could use the tool, and I began to think about how I could turn it
into a web-app.

Fast forward a few months and I've saved enough to work on this full-time.
There's going to be a lot to learn because I'm not a web-developer, yet. I'm
starting my journey by learning javaScript. Which feels very basic compared to
my ambitions.
