# What is it?

In April 2022 I bought the ZSA [Moonlander Mark 1](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) keyboard. It's a
customizable split mechanical keyboard, and each half can be tilted.

8 months later I bought the "Platform" accessory - a stand that adds a lot of weight and allows each
half to be tilted up to 57 degrees. The extra weight and anti-slip pads stops each half from moving
and makes the keyboard feel a lot more rigid and robust.

I bought it partly as an experiment and partly as a toy. The review articles were glowing and I
figured that I spend so much time with a keyboard that even a small improvement would create a big
benefit over time.

## Hardware setup and customization

The Moonlander is very customizable - you can change the angle that each half is tilted at, and of
course you can position each half to be whatever distance and rotation you find comfortable. The
keyboard caps are a standard size so you can replace them if you want to, though I haven't done this
because the standard caps feel great and the idea is to use the keyboard without looking at it.

I have replaced the key switches though - they're "hot swappable" which means you can simply pull
them out of the keyboard's circuit board - no need for solder. This is a big advantage because the
switches are the main source of noise and tactile feedback. Being able to choose your own switches
will make the keyboard fit in with your preferences more than almost any other feature.

The Moonlander has all the RGB light options you can imagine, and I use none of them. It also has a
mostly undocumented musical keyboard setting. You could play happy birthday to your colleagues if
you wanted.

I modified the keyboard by adding some foam packaging into the housing so that the sound is duller
and softer when typing. I also replaced the switches with ALIAZ
[Silent Tactile Switches](https://kbdfans.com/products/pre-orderaliaz-silent-switch-tactile) - these
were the only silent _and_ tactile switches I could find, and I realised after some experimentation
that I really wanted to be able to type quietly.

## Firmware customization

The software to program what each key does is also very customizable, and there are a lot of tools
to help you practice too. The keyboard supports multiple layers of keys, as well as macros,
modifiers and combinations.

I was surprised by the scope of the software and firmware tools that ZSA offers - its clearly not an
afterthought to the main product, but a core part of their offering. The tools really help you setup
and get the most out of the keyboard and for the most part do it simply and intuitively.

Even though there are plenty of online and offline tools to setup and program the moonlander, the
changes themselves are to the firmware, so you don't need any software to make the keyboard work.
You can plug it into any computer and be fine.

# The learning curve

Getting used to a split keyboard is not easy or fast. The first few weeks are really tricky because
it feels so unusual to have your hands far apart, and muscle-memory tends to work against you.

I also had never given much thought to the most ergonomic way of hitting a comma or question mark,
and it took me a while to figure out an approach I was happy with.

I also found the amount of customization to be almost overwhelming - you can design your layout
almost anyway you want, I'd never used thumb clusters before and found it easiest to avoid all but
the two nearest thumb-cluster keys until I was more comfortable with everything else.

I also realised that I prefer to have each hand oriented towards the left side of each half, and
that I want to keep my fingers close to the home-row as much as possible.

You can see my [layout history here](https://configure.zsa.io/my_layout/view/Dnj6q). Its been a long
an iterative process.

# Summary

- Change things gradually. You can't go directly from using a laptop keyboard to your optimal split
  keyboard layout, You will have to have intermediate layouts that you tweak as you get used to
  things. Because:

  - You don't know what the optimal layout is.
  - The learning curve is too steep otherwise.
  - Optimal depends on what keys you can comfortably hit, and that will change as your hands become
    more used to various movements that are unique to thumb clusters and split keyboards.

- I quickly became comfortable with the tilting but the split took longer to get adapt to, I was
  used to pressing `y` and `n` with my left hand, for example.

# The Platform

"The Platform" is an accessory that lets you tilt (or tent) the Moonlander even further. It also
makes each half a lot heavier and grips the desk far better. I think its still in beta - ZSA seem to
be doing limited runs. Initially I dismissed it as expensive and unnecessary, but came to regret
this and bought one from the second product run.

It adds a lot of weight and rigidity to the Moonlander and really changes how the product feels. It
raises the keyboard up about 10mm or so, increases the tilt of each half, and in my opinion makes
the keyboard feel a lot more luxurious and more visually striking. Most importantly, the extra tilt
is more comfortable and it's easier to type quickly and accurately.

# Conclusions

- I've learnt a lot more about keyboard ergonomics than I bargained for.
- I know that being able to type silently is more important than any other switch characteristic.
- When choosing which to keys to program to do a particular thing, some actions benefit from a big
  unusual movement (like switching application by reaching for a thumb cluster), whilst some actions
  feel best when making a small fast movement (like typing punctuation)
- Having bought new switches, and the Platform accessory, this has become a really expensive
  keyboard. If I use it continually for many years then I think its a fine investment - I'll rack up
  thousands of hours with it.
- Its taken about 8 months to start feeling like I'm more productive, faster, and more accurate than
  with a normal keyboard. It was usable after a couple of months, but only now does it feel
  significantly more accurate, and therefore faster.
- Your time investment will likely be different based on how rapidly you iterate to your ideal
  layout
