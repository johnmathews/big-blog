A [blog post](https://lethain.com/eng-strategies/) about engineering strategy. This author has
written a lot about software engineering management - my blog has links to some of his other
articles.

The author has written a book "Staff Engineer", and his site seems to be the best online resource
for information about engineering management and how to be specifically a senior software engineer.
