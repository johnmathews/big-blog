A long and interesting article [article](https://sadh.life/post/builtins/) about
Python.

Also this [article](https://treyhunner.com/2019/05/python-builtins-worth-learning/) by Trey Hunner.

On a related nots, I remember Aaron Maxwell (of Powerful Python) suggesting that
reading the source code for modules you use all the time is a great way to see
high quality code and to stretch your understanding.
