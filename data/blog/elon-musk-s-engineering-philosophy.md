Whilst giving Tim Dodd a tour of a SpaceX facility, Musk described an interesting five-step
engineering process:

1.  **Make the requirements less dumb**.

    - The requirements are definitely dumb; it does not matter who gave them to you.
    - Requirements are particularly dangerous if an intelligent person created them, because you may
      not question them enough.
    - "Everyone’s wrong. No matter who you are, everyone is wrong some of the time."
    - "All designs are wrong, it’s just a matter of how wrong."

1.  **Try very hard to delete the process or the component**.

    - If parts are not being added back into the design at least 10% of the time, not enough parts
      are being deleted.
    - Musk noted that the bias tends to be very strongly toward “let’s add this part or process step
      in case we need it.”
    - Each requirement must come from a name, not a department.
    - A department cannot be asked why a requirement exists, but a person can.

1.  **Simplify and optimize the design. Remove stuff**.

    - The most common error for a smart engineer is to optimize something that should not exist.

1.  **Accelerate cycle time**.

    - "You’re moving too slowly, go faster! But don’t go faster until you've worked on the other
      three things first.”

1.  **Automate**.

    - An important part of this is to remove in-process testing after the problems have been
      diagnosed;
    - If a product is reaching the end of a production line with a high acceptance rate, there is no
      need for in-process testing.
