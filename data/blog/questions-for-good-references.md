Use the following questions to get better references:

1. What was the problem you had before you used the solution I helped develop?
2. What did the frustration feel like as you tried to solve the problem?
3. What was different about the solution I worked on compared to previous
   efforts?
4. Take us to the moment you realized our solution was actually working to solve
   the problem?
5. What does life look like now that the problem is being solved?

Customize the text as necessary, for products or services, complete solutions
are a component of a larger solution.

I made a [template]({attach}/documents/reference-questions.docx).
