The chapter starts with <mark>"Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he
who hates reproof is stupid."</mark> and ends with <mark>"In the path of
righteousness is life, and in its pathway there is no death."</mark>

The opening proverb is jarring to read, maybe because unlike "wickedness" or "righteousness",
which are concepts I don't hear or think much about day-to-day, "discipline" and
"knowledge" are very familiar and part of contemporary conversation. So is
stupidity. So this proverb feels tangible.

What does it mean? If I love discipline then I am loving knowledge, and in this
case I'm confident the opposite is also true - If I avoid or dislike discipline
then I avoid or dislike knowledge. Discipline is hard, I guess I need to lean
into being disciplined, and remember why.

Encouragingly, the proverb is immediately followed by the reminder that <mark>"A good
man obtains favour from the Lord, but a man of evil devices he condemns"</mark>, so
make an effort, do good things, and obtain favour. That's a big reason to
persevere through discipline.

$^4$<mark>"An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she who brings
shame is like rottenness in his bones."</mark> If it were me I'd leave off all
the negative second parts of these proverbs, its abrasive. But also if it were
me I doubt they'd be worth studying.

Why is the pattern of all these proverbs "good thing, bad thing" - to make the
contrast stronger? To know why to do a thing and also why not to do the
opposite? To make it more punchy? I guess if its abrasive you are more likely to
remember it, and if you're confident that what you are saying is true then you
want it to be remembered.

Back to the proverb, this is a great proverb - I like it. It honors wives,
though it does put them in the context of their husbands, and it also speaks to
how valuable and precious a good wife is - crowns are precious and rare.

Empirically, it also feels _thruthy_ - marriages are difficult and if either
spouse can be considered "excellent" then that is unusual and valuable.
Relationships can give a lot of life and health and happiness, and require a lot
of effort and work. To be an excellent spouse is certainly worth desiring and
celebrating and protecting.

The next few verses contrast wickedness and righteousness - don't be wicked, be
upright!

$^9$ <mark>"Better to be lowly and have a servant that to play the great man and lack
bread"</mark>. Don't put appearances before substance? Don't spend money on fancy cars
or clothes if you wont have enough for decent food? Prioritize substance
(truth?) over appearances and social pressures? Having a servant (or a domestic
helper) would certainly be helpful, and of more tangible benefit than receiving
shout-outs at networking events.

$^{10}$ <mark>"Whoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast, but the mercy of the
wicked is cruel."</mark> - animal welfare is important.

$^{11}$ <mark>Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who
follows worthless pursuits lacks sense.</mark>

11 and 12 are both about enjoying the good consequences of honest work, 11
advises against worthless pursuits, and 12 says that is a wicked to covet the
profits of evildoers.

Verses 13 - 19 are all about speaking and listening. Each proverb contrasts good and
evil or wisdom and foolishness.

- 13 - your own dishonest words will become a trap for you.
- 14 - you words and your works will come back to you - invest in them and dividends will be returned.
- 17, 18 - these contrast each other. Your words are powerful,
  speaking the truth is honest (even when it isn't simple, or if it makes a
  situation more complicated) and being rash (acting without careful
  consideration of the consequences) can be as violent as wielding a sword. Wise
  words bring healing, though.

$^{15}$ Fools think they are right, and because of the contrasting pattern
presumably do not listen to (or ask for) advice. This seems similar to the
[Dunning-Kruger
Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) Wise people
know that they don't know everything they need to, ask for advice, and listen to
it.

$^{16}$ I had to look up _Vexation_ - it means "the state of being annoyed,
frustrated or worried". Wise people can stay calm and ignore insults. If you
get all fired up when someone insults you you're probably (generally speaking)
being foolish.

$^{19}$ <mark>Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue is but for a
moment.</mark>

Truth endures, lies do not.

Verses 20 - 29 have two themes - the benefits of consistent hard work, and the
benefits of being truthful. As usual, each proverb is a comparison of right and
wrong or wisdom and foolishness:

$^{21}$ <mark>No ill befalls the righteous, but the wicked are filled with
trouble.</mark> This is encouraging to read, and also highlights that proverbs
highlight truthful patterns, but are not specific guarantees. - Obviously
righteous people will have trouble, this proverb isn't saying that life will be
perfectly pleasant. As usual, it is a push towards doing good because of the
benefits, a pull away from doing wrong because of the damage.

$^{22}$ <mark>.. those who act faithfully are his delight.</mark> It is
wonderful to read that (a good) God would delight in people.

$^{23}$ <mark>A prudent man conceals knowledge, but the heart of a fool
proclaims knowledge.</mark> I find it surprising to read that concealing
knowledge can be a desirable trait. I guess there are certain questions that
must be answered before the answers to other questions can be understood, and I
know that for my young children I wouldn't answer particular questions that same
as if they were adults.

$^{24}$ <mark>The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be
put to forced labor.</mark> Its ironic, and counter-intuitive, that those who are
diligent and able and willing to labor end up in management or leadership
positions, and that those who would avoid laborious work end up doing it.

$^{25}$ <mark>Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, but a good word makes
him glad.</mark> I find it encouraging (again) to read that being weighed down
by anxiety is normal, and I like that anxiety isn't described as a weakness or as
foolishness. (I don't want to conjecture too much about what isn't written, but
there's a long list of things that fools do and the consequences of foolishness,
and anxiety isn't on the list.) This proverb also emphasises and
encourages the impact of good words.

$^{28}$ <mark>In the path of righteousness is life, and in its pathway there is
no death.</mark> How wonderful to know how to find life and avoid death. It's
such a pleasing way to end a chapter.
