I've been trying to replace ALE with CoC. It didn't work. Maybe I have unusually
high fixing expectations, but ALE is more capable and easier to setup. So I'll
be using CoC and ALE together, which feels messy.

## Formatting

1.  `pip install pep8 autopep8`
1.  `<leader>fs`

- `<leader>a` - a list of all the wrong things
- `vif` - select inside function
- `vam` - select method

- `<leader>ac` - see a box with options to fix imports or ignore file
