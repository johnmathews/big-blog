[This paper](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/cognitive-bias/2020-levitt.pdf) concludes that
people are excessively cautious when making big decisions. This corresponds to my personal

## Abstract

Little is known about whether people make good choices when facing important decisions. This article
reports on a large-scale randomized field experiment in which research subjects having difficulty
making a decision flipped a coin to help determine their choice.

For important decisions (e.g. quitting a job or ending a relationship), individuals who are told by
the coin toss to make a change are more likely to make a change, more satisfied with their
decisions, and happier six months later than those whose coin toss instructed maintaining the status
quo.

This finding suggests that people may be excessively cautious when facing life-changing choices,
