Misonne would often photograph things that were strongly illuminated from behind, producing a halo
effect. He would also retouch the lighting effects in his photographs, experimenting with and using
many techniques, such as the Fresson process and later the bromoil and mediobrome processes. He also
invented the "flou-net" and "photo-dessin" processes.
