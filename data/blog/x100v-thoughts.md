## Background

Over the last 20 years I've often found photography mesmerizing and frustrating. I've also noticed
memories changing over time. I've realised that my thoughts or opinions about a past event are very
much dependent on other disconnected events.

Photography offers an opportunity to curate our past. Maybe that's obvious, and it requires
recognising the value of the present. Choose what is important, say it visually, and cast it into
something that cannot be changed.

## HP850

I bought my first camera because I was frustrated with my inability to paint. It was an
[HP850](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/hp850) I bought sometime around 2002, and it was probably
awful. I poured so much attention and ambition into it that googling it and seeing it for the first
time in ~20 years brought back a wave of feelings. I remember it feeling advanced and powerful, and
I also remember it being useful in low light situations. Absolutely useless. I can still remember
some of the photos I made with it, in the fields near my parents house in Shropshire.

The next camera I bought, probably around 2005 was a Ricoh. I can't remember the model. It was also
a small fixed lens camera, but it was sold with promises of much improved low light capabilities,
and competent autofocus. Maybe it had a much higher maximum ISO setting, but unfortunately it was
still useless in low light and the auto focus was terrible.

Cameras with interchangeable lenses were too expensive, but were becoming cheaper and I concluded
that if I really wanted to do photography then I would need to a DSLR. At the time, "photography"
meant using film, and you had to say "digital" if you weren't using film.

## Nikon D80

I bought a [Nikon D80](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond80) with a kit lens, and eventually a
50mm prime. I treasured it, knew its menus backwards, and began to learn about photography. I was
asked to photograph a wedding, and shortly after decided to commit and buy a body with a full-frame
sensor and some better lenses.

Financially this was a mistake. I'd received a university scholarship and spent most of it on the
camera body and 3 zooms. It's painful to think about but I have a hunch the experience led to other
good things, and was a good lesson to learn early. Nonetheless, that money could have been better
used on other experiences that would probably have been more beneficial.

This was around 2010, and my way of learning photography was the occasional book from Amazon and
reading about ~100 photography blogs. Most of these blogs were pure marketing, and I didn't realise
this until much later. I don't recall knowing any professional (or semi-professional) photographers
personally, and after a few years I became frustrated with my photography skills.

I also disliked how the act of photography made me an observer and took me out of the moment.
Carrying a big heavy camera with a big heavy lens is a statement that has consequences. The quality
and utility of camera phones was increasing and I enjoyed using the camera on my iPhone far more
than my cumbersome Nikon. I decided to let professional photography slide and make photographs only
when I felt like it. More fun, no pressure. Be present in the moment.

12 years later in 2022, I was watching YouTube and following a
[German couple bikepack](https://www.youtube.com/@HenryMerk) across Europe. They were creating great
videos including beautiful photographs, and I wondered how they were doing it whilst carrying
everything on their bike.

Henry was using a Fujifilm X-T4, an external mic, and a smartphone. I wondered how much photography
had changed in the last decade, and I was amazed how much I could learn from other photographer's
YouTube channels. The utility and quality of YouTube had improved massively.

## Fujifilm XT-5

This brings us to 2023.

Obsessing over gear is easy, and damages ones creativity. In the past I've become so aware of
technical limitations that creativity had suffered[^1]. I wanted to avoid that, and figured I could
avoid the slippery slope of comparison by erring on the side of decisive brevity. I would keep
things simple and accept the risk of being suboptimal. Henry Merk produces work that I find
inspiring, so I use the same stuff that he uses. Simple.

And I guess it worked - I bought an X-T5 and some primes[^2], and got to work. I made progress,
became comfortable with the camera and had fun making some photographs. I was progressing.

A good photograph often looks simple. Beauty often hides complexity. But the act of photography -
including editing - is not simple at all. You need stuff, you need time, you need opportunity and
you need to try hard. So in addition to the new camera and lenses I now have a new laptop, which I
would have needed to buy eventually, anyway. (The old laptop was almost 4 years old.) A laptop that
takes several seconds to process edits or to show another photo does not encourage nascent creative
flow. It's frustrating how complex the feedback loop can be - make some photos, cull and edit them,
reflect, repeat.

## The X100V

I'm not sure when I first learnt about the
[X100V](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fujifilm+x100v+), but I certainly tried to
ignore it. I hate that I find gear reviews interesting. It's so much easier to consume content than
to produce something. The comparisons to Leica certainly caught my attention though. And the hype
seemed extraordinary. It's 3 years old and they're out of stock everywhere. Second hand models sell
for more than the list price of a new model. Fuji have stopped taking new orders because they cant
produce cameras fast enough to fill existing orders...

I visited family in London recently and despite knowing that many moments would make a nice
photograph or were worthy of being documented, my XT-5 stayed in its bag.I didn't want to change the
moment by putting a large (maybe only medium) lump of metal and glass on the table, or point it at
someone and interrupt them. Photography is art and full of intangible reactions. Qualitative
considerations have consequences and a small playful camera like the X100V leads to different
photographs that something larger like an XT-5.

I run a lot - slow and far - and I often see things I'd like to photograph. I tried putting the XT-5
in my pack whilst running, but this requires stopping, taking the pack off, unzipping it and then
beginning to photograph. Its arduous, slow, laborious.

And then you have to do it all in reverse when you're ready to move on. Hopefully you haven't cooled
down too much, and hopefully its easy to get back into the surprisingly blissful flow of running
whilst hungry and tired. I love to run because it feels like perpetual motion - moving forward
through changing and remote (ish) landscapes whilst relying on tired legs and limited calories. I
wish I could have carried my XT-5 whilst keeping it accessible.

I've sold the XT-5, and the three prime lenses. I imported a second hand X100V from Seoul. I thought
I was getting a deal but that was before the import tax. My bad. The net difference in cost is
almost zero.

I am surprised that a 3 year old, fixed lens camera, with half hearted video capabilities, no IBIS,
a short lived battery and a mere 24 megapixel sensor, could be better (to me, in almost every
meaningful sense) than the latest flagship camera body and some incredible lenses.

But I think this shows how much I still have to learn about the art of photography, and about
resisting marketing FUD. All the outstanding and incredible photographs I find inspiring were made
using equipment far, far worse than a camera phone, right?[^3] Some technical specifications matter
more than others, and for me, size is almost at the top. If it can't fit in my pocket then it
probably won't be in my hand.

After two weeks of fun and frequent photography of the streets, my village, my kids, my house...
here are some thoughts.

## Thoughts after 1 week

1. It's **fun**. This is not a trivial quality for a complicated tool to possess.
2. It's small(er) and that's a really big deal, more than I expected.
3. It's very right-handed. Probably the most right-handed object I own. I am left handed.
4. You can use it with one hand, this is also a really big deal.
5. Having any camera in your hand, or pocket, is totally different and preferably to having a better
   camera in your bag.
6. Having a built in flash is super fun and engaging. It's a fun "look", and it changes the
   experience of being photographed for the better. The subject knows when the photo has been taken,
   it's more of an "event", more different, and therefore more special. It "feels" like they've had
   their photo taken in a more tangible way than without a flash.
7. It looks inviting and interesting to the people who will be in your photographs.
8. The lens is wonderful. It makes beautiful photos.
9. The controls are great - the aperture ring, shutter speed dial and exposure compensation dials in
   particular feel sturdy and well made. It feels good to hold and operate.
10. The dials are strong, firm, and clicky. They feel premium.
11. The camera feels like it'll last a long time.
12. The view finder is fun.
13. The flip screen is great for waste height shots

## Improvements

If and when a successor arrives..

1. Bigger battery - you want to start the day with a full battery for sure
2. A quieter lens
3. More megapixels. Seriously. It's a prime lens and sometimes I want to crop a lot. It was nice to
   have 40 on the XT-5.
4. Better autofocus when there is bright light behind the subject.
5. The Fuji UI isn't intuitive. I have to google so many menu items to figure out what it does.
6. Better video - 4k 60, 6k 30 would be nice. Recording for more than 10 minutes would be useful for
   interviews and conversations.
7. IBIS. But not at the expense of size.
8. A dedicated switch or button to go into video mode - I really want to use this camera for video
   too! Don't bury the switch in a menu.
9. Different sets of custom modes for video and stills - like on the XT-5.
10. A screen that can tilt "vertically" as well as horizontally. I'd also like it to
    flip all the way around - through 180 degrees - so that I can see the screen whilst standing in
    front of the camera.

That is all.

    This might be unfair. I remember vividly the difference between my photographs and the quality
    (or viewing experience) of work created by professionals with best-in-class equipment. At the
    time I didn't understand how technical specifications could limit perceived quality. 4
    megapixels was normal and 10 Megapixels was a lot. I still don't have a great understanding of
    how lens quality contributes to an emotional connection with a photograph. I thought that I
    should be able to create work with my equipment that was as good as the pro's, but
    simultaneously knew that my lenses were wide open (at f3.5) and I was at the very limits of
    usable ISO (3200, maybe).

[^2]:
    I prefer primes to zooms. Around 2011 I'd grown tired of carrying
    [massive zooms](https://www.dpreview.com/products/nikon/lenses/nikon_z_24-70_2p8_s) around and
    was delighted to find that primes were chepaer, lighter, smaller and super good quality. All you
    had to do was move your feet more. I bought 50mm and 35mm primes, and I think I had another too.
    They were also made of metal rather than plastic. Once, in eastern europe somewhere, a prime
    rolled out of my bag and down a cobbled street. It made no difference.

[^3]:
    I disagree with myself - it is the wrong way to think about the topic - photography has become
    more accessible.
