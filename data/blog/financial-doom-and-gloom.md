Financial crises seem to happen fairly regularly so they shouldn't be
unexpected. But no-one seems particularly concerned about our current financial
system, at the moment our attention is controlled by other threats.

I'm concerned that a lot of money has been injected into the money supply but
we haven't seen any inflation. And I am concerned that the price of stocks
is no longer related to the value created by the company but instead by macro
economics.

It's a terrible time to be a value investor. This should be an alarming
statement. Value investing should _always_ be a decent way to make money
unless markets are broken. If the price of something doesn't represent its
value then a correction is inevitable.

Interest rates are really low at the moment so if you have spare money and you
want to make it work for you then where do you put it? Not into a bank account,
because interest rates are low[ref]Why are interest rates low? Because
confidence in the economy is low, so central bankers have to lower interest
rates to make it 1. Cheaper for a business to borrow money to invest in their business and
therefore easier for a business investments to be profitable, and 2. So that
its more attractive for investors to use their capital to invest in a business
(which grows the economy) relative to depositing spare cash in a bank account (which is safer but a less efficient way to deploy capital). Interest rates affect the relative risk-reward ratios of
different investment strategies[/ref], and not into government debt, because
the yield is so low. It has to be stocks if you want the value of your
investments to increase meaningfully.

But everyone is doing this which drives the price up, and because their price
is increasing they increase even further.

I think that the main reason for concern is super low interest rates and
massive increases in the money supply, but there are a couple of other factors
that are also contributing.

It's easier than ever for retail investors to participate in the stock market,
and this seems like a good idea. Democratization. However if retail investors
have influence to effect prices, and they themselves can be manipulated or
influenced regarding what or when they buy or sell, then that is likely a new
kind of threat to financial stability. We've never seen social media combined
with quick, cheap investment services for amateurs before.

Index funds are also more popular than ever[ref][index funds are the new kings of wall street](https://web.archive.org/web/20210119144242/https://www.wsj.com/articles/index-funds-are-the-new-kings-of-wall-street-11568799004)[/ref] - the efficacy of index investing
relative to traditional funds that use stock pickers is very high over medium
or long time horizons because index funds are much cheaper. But if index
funds become too large then they end up influencing the market in predictable
and rigid ways.

Index funds cannot choose what they buy or how much they buy - they just track
the index. If a company's stock crosses certain thresholds, their stock has
to be bought or sold. It seems like its possible to create feedback loops where
funds have to buy more of a rising stock, which increases its scarcity and
price, which then requires index funds to purchase more of the same stock.

The amount of euros in existence in 2019 was 90% more than in 2010.[ref][statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/254220/value-of-euro-coins-in-circulation-since-2002/)[/ref]
But inflation between 2010 and 2020 is
13%.[ref][in2013dollars.com](https://www.in2013dollars.com/europe/inflation/2010)[/ref]
Why is that?

If the price of something doesn't represent its value, then a correction is
inevitable.
