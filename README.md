# Personal blog built using Tailwind and Nextjs.

[Original template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)

I should write some context here. Including:

- what the blog is for.
- how I use it
- which commands to run to:
  - create a new post,
  - deploy to vercel,
  - build search cache,
  - build sitemap
  - or just look in `package.json`
- how to use snippets
- some of the keyboard shortcuts
- the video archive feature
- how GCP buckets are used
