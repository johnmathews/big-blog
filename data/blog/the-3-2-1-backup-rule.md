- **3 copies, 2 types of media, 1 copy off-site**
- Have 1 primary backup and 2 duplicates, in additional to the original data.
- NAS, USB drive, Cloud storage, Server, Glacier, etc

For example, your laptop could be backed up to a NAS, a server, and glacier
storage. Or 2 NAS and 1 archival cloud storage.
